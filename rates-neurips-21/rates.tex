\begin{abstract}
  In supervised machine learning, often a target problem is solved by minimizing a surrogate loss on a dataset.
  Study of convergence rates, which bound generalization error as a function of dataset size, typically neglects the relationship between the target and surrogate problems.
  We consider the transfer of rate guarantees from the surrogate loss to the target problem.
  We show that any consistent piecewise-linear convex (i.e. polyhedral) surrogate achieves a linear transfer rate, i.e. fast convergence of excess risk in the surrogate implies fast convergence in the target.
  Simple counterexamples show that transfer rates can be much slower, e.g. quadratic, when the surrogate is smooth or strongly convex.

\section{Introduction}

Machine learning is important.

Mention that the techniques focus on the ``conditional problem''.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Setting}

\paragraph{Target problems.}
We consider supervised machine learning problems where data points have features in $\X$ and labels in $\Y$, a finite space.
The set of probability distributions on $\Y$ is denoted $\simplex\subseteq\reals^{\Y}_+$, represented as vectors $p$ with $\|p\|_1 = 1$.

The goal or \emph{target problem} is to learn a hypothesis mapping $\X$ to a finite \emph{report (or prediction) space} $\R$, possibly different from $\Y$.
For example, in classification with an abstain option, $\R = \Y \cup \{\bot\}$ where $\bot$ represents abstaining from choosing a label.
In a ranking problem, $\R$ is the set of all permutations of $\Y$.

We suppose the target problem is specified by a \emph{discrete loss function} $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, which maps a report (prediction) $r \in \R$ to the vector $\ell(r)$ of nonnegative loss values for each label, i.e. $\ell(r) = (\ell(r)_y)_{y\in\Y}$.
We will assume throughout that the target loss is \emph{non-redundant}, meaning every report $r \in \R$ is uniquely optimal (uniquely minimizes expected loss) for some distribution $p\in\simplex$.

\paragraph{Surrogate losses.}
Because optimizing discrete loss on a dataset is typically intractable, the usual approach is to instead learn a hypothesis of the form $h: \X \to \reals^d$ by minimizing a \emph{surrogate loss function} $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$.
A surrogate loss is associated with a \emph{link function} $\psi: \reals^d \to \R$.
If the learned hypothesis predicts $h(x) \in \reals^d$, then the implied prediction for the target problem is $\psi(h(x)) \in \R$.
For example, in binary classification, the target problem is to predict a label from $\R = \Y = \{-1,+1\}$ and one often uses the link $\psi(u) = \mathrm{sign}(u)$, which maps negative predictions to $-1$ and nonnegative predictions to $+1$.
We will typically abstract away from the hypothesis $h$, as this paper focuses on properties of the losses $\ell(r)$ and $L(u)$ as functions of the predictions $r \in \R$ and $u \in \reals^d$.

\paragraph{Expected loss and Bayes risk.}
When $Y \sim p$, we write the expected target loss of prediction $r$ and expected surrogate loss of prediction $u$ respectively as $\inprod{p}{\ell(r)}$ and $\inprod{p}{L(u)}$.
The \emph{Bayes risk} of a discrete target loss $\ell: \R \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ is the function $\risk{\ell}: \simplex \to \reals_+$ given by $\risk{\ell}(p) = \inf_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{\ell(r)}$.
Similarly, the Bayes risk of a surrogate $L: \reals^d \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ is given by $\risk{L}(p) = \inf_{u\in\reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}$.
Note that we define Bayes risk pointwise, i.e. we have abstracted away from the role of the features $\X$ and focus directly on conditional distributions $p$ on $\Y$.

\paragraph{Polyhedral surrogates.}
We say a surrogate $L$ is \emph{polyhedral} if it is piecewise linear and convex.
To introduce this definition more formally, let us recall some definitions from convex geometry.
In $\reals^d$, a \emph{polyhedral set} or \emph{polyhedron} is the intersection of a finite number of closed halfspaces.
% A \emph{polytope} is a bounded polyhedral set.
A convex function $f:\reals^d\to\reals$ is \emph{polyhedral} if its epigraph is polyhedral, or equivalently, if it can be written as a pointwise maximum of a finite set of affine functions~\cite{rockafellar1997convex}.

\begin{definition}[Polyhedral loss]
  A loss $L: \reals^d \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ is \emph{polyhedral} if $L(u)_y$ is a polyhedral (convex) function of $u$ for each $y\in\Y$.
  \bo{Can we omit ``(convex)''?}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Surrogate regrets and transfer rates}

In supervised machine learning we are given a data set $S_m = ((x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_m,y_m)) \sim \D^m$, that is, $m$ points drawn i.i.d. from a distribution $\D$ on $\X \times \Y$.
Write $\D_{\X}$ for the marginal distribution of $\D$ on $\X$, and for $(X,Y) \sim \D$, write $p_x$ for the conditional distribution on $Y$ given $X=x$.

Given a target loss $\ell: \R \to \reals^{\Y}_+$, our goal is to output a hypothesis $g: \X \to \R$ minimizing \emph{target risk} $E_{X \sim \D_\X} \inprod{p_X}{\ell(g(X))}$.
Then we can define the \emph{excess risk} or \emph{regret} of $g$ as the risk of $g$, minus the risk of the Bayes optimal predictor.
\begin{definition}[Regret] \label{def:full-regret}
  For a loss $\ell: \R \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ and distribution $p \in \simplex$, the \emph{conditional regret} of a prediction $r \in \R$ is given by $R_{\ell}(r,p) = \inprod{p}{\ell(r)} - \risk{\ell}(p)$.

  In slight abuse of notation, the \emph{regret} of a hypothesis $g: \X \to \R$ is given by $R_{\ell}(g, \D) = \E_{X \sim \D_{\X}} R_{\ell}(g(X), p_X)$.
\end{definition}
Naturally, the same definitions hold with the notation of surrogate losses, i.e. we have conditional regret $R_L(u,p) = \inprod{p}{L(u)} - \risk{L}(p)$ and we have regret $R_L(h,\D) = E_{X \sim \D_{\X}} R_L(h(X), p_X)$.


%The primary focus of this paper is on surrogate regret bounds, which bound the excess target loss in terms of the excess surrogate loss.
%
%\begin{definition}[Regret]\label{def:regret}
%  For loss $L:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$ and distribution $p\in\simplex$, the \emph{regret} of a prediction $r\in\R$ is given by $R_L(r,p) = \inprod{p}{L(r)} - \risk{L}(p)$.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Surrogate Regret Bound]\label{def:regret-bound}
%  A \emph{surrogate regret bound} between target $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y$ and surrogate $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$, together with a link $\psi : \reals^d \to \R$, is the statement
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:regret-bound-general}
%    \forall p\in\simplex, u\in\reals^d, \quad R_\ell(\psi(u),p) \leq \zeta(\, R_L(u,p) \,)~,
%  \end{equation}
%  for some function $\zeta : \reals_+ \to \reals_+$ which is continuous at $0$ and satisfies $\zeta(0) = 0$.
%\end{definition}
%
%
%
%\subsection{Property elicitation and consistency}
%
%Given a target problem specified by $\ell$, when is it appropriate to use a surrogate $L$?
%A key necessary condition is \emph{consistency} \bo{cite}, which roughly states that 
%
%

%$\Gamma: \simplex \toto \R$ is shorthand for $\Gamma: \simplex \to 2^{\R} \setminus \{\emptyset\}$.
%
%\begin{definition}[Property, level set]\label{def:property}
%  A \emph{property} is a function $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\R$.
%  The \emph{level set} of $\Gamma$ for report $r$ is the set $\Gamma_r \defeq \{p \in \simplex : r \in \Gamma(p)\}$.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Elicits]
%  \label{def:elicits}
%  A loss $L:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, \emph{elicits} a property $\Gamma:\simplex \toto \R$ if
%  \begin{equation}
%    \forall p\in\simplex,\;\;\;\Gamma(p) = \argmin_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{L(r)}~.
%  \end{equation}
%  As $L$ elicits a unique property, we write $\prop{L}$ to refer to the property elicited by a loss $L$.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}[Embedding a loss]\label{def:loss-embed}
%  A loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$ \emph{embeds} a loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y$ if there exists some injective embedding $\varphi:\R\to\reals^d$ such that
%  (i) for all $r\in\R$ we have $L(\varphi(r)) = \ell(r)$, and (ii) for all $p\in\simplex,r\in\R$ we have
%  \begin{equation}\label{eq:embed-loss}
%    r \in \prop{\ell}(p) \iff \varphi(r) \in \prop{L}(p)~.
%  \end{equation}
%\end{definition}
