\begin{abstract}
  In supervised machine learning, often a target problem is solved by minimizing a surrogate loss on a dataset.
  Study of convergence rates, which bound generalization error as a function of dataset size, typically neglects the relationship between the target and surrogate problems.
  We consider the transfer of rate guarantees from the surrogate loss to the target problem.
  We show that any consistent piecewise-linear convex (i.e. polyhedral) surrogate achieves a linear transfer rate, i.e. fast convergence of excess risk in the surrogate implies fast convergence in the target.
  Simple counterexamples show that transfer rates can be much slower, e.g. quadratic, when the surrogate is smooth or strongly convex.

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{The surrogate risk framework.}
In supervised learning, data is of the form $(x,y)$ and the goal is to learn a hypothesis $g(x)$.
This paper considers the common setting where the space of labels $y$ is finite, as is the space of predictions $g(x)$, and accuracy is measured with a \emph{target loss function} $\ell(g(x),y)$.

Because these discrete settings are generally computationally challenging, a common paradigm is to learn $g$ via \emph{surrogate risk minimization}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define a \emph{surrogate loss function} $L(h(x),y)$ over a more-tractable continuous, convex prediction space.
  \item Learn a hypothesis $h(x)$ mapping $x$ to this new prediction space.
  \item Produce a hypothesis $g(x)$ for the original, target problem using some link function $\psi$ via $g(x) = \psi(h(x))$.
\end{enumerate}
For example, in binary classification, the target problem is given by $0$-$1$ loss, $\ell(r)_y = \ones\{r\neq y\}$, with surrogate losses typically defined over $\reals$.
Common surrogate losses include hinge loss and logistic loss.
These surrogates are typically associated with the link $\psi(u) = \mathrm{sign}(u)$, which maps negative predictions to $-1$ and nonnegative predictions to $+1$.

\paragraph{Rates of convergence.}
Given $n$ data points and a surrogate loss $L$, a learning algorithm should produce a hypothesis $h_n$ whose loss converges to the optimal possible as $n$ increases.
Specifically, we can define $\mathrm{Regret}_{L}(h)$ as the expected loss of $h$ on the data distribution, minus the expected loss of the Bayes optimal predictor, i.e. the measurable function with least loss.
Then a primary goal is to bound the \emph{convergence rate} of this algorithm, i.e. provide a bound of the form $\mathrm{Regret}_{L}(h_n) \leq O\left(\tfrac{1}{n^{\alpha}}\right)$.
Such bounds for $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ are considered ``slow'' rates and are guaranteed by e.g. VC-dimension bounds.\bo{cite}
Faster rates such as $\alpha = 1$ are obtainable is some settings.\bo{cite}

\paragraph{Problem: relating surrogate and target regret.}
However, results of the above form do not guarantee the success of the learning framework for the original, target problem.
Even if the surrogate regret $\mathrm{Regret}_L(h_n)$ is small, we actually care about the induced target hypothesis $g_n = \psi \circ h_n$.
Will the target regret necessarily be small?
Motivated by this problem, this paper will study \emph{surrogate regret bounds}.\bo{cite}
%A surrogate regret bound answers the following question: when we minimize the \emph{surrogate} regret at a given rate, how fast does the \emph{target} regret diminish?
Informally, a surrogate regret bound takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surrogate-regret-bound-informal}
  \forall \text{ hypotheses } h:\X\to\reals^d, \quad \mathrm{Regret}_\ell(\psi\circ h) \leq \zeta(\, \mathrm{Regret}_L(h) \,)~,
\end{equation}
where the regret transfer function $\zeta : \reals_+ \to \reals_+$ controls how surrogate regret translates to target regret.
For example, \bo{cite} studies the \bo{??} surrogate loss for the \bo{??} problem, achieving a guarantee of $\zeta(\epsilon) \leq O\left(\sqrt{\epsilon}\right)$.

While such a guarantee is certainly nice, it is not ideal: even if one achieves a fast rate of $O(\tfrac{1}{n})$ for the surrogate problem, this only translates to the slow rate guarantee of $O(\tfrac{1}{n^{1/2}})$ in the target problem that we actually want to solve.
Preferable would be a transfer function such as $\zeta(\epsilon) = O(\epsilon^{3/4})$ or even $\zeta(\epsilon) = O(\epsilon)$, a linear transfer rate.

\raf{Of particular interest is the concavity of $\zeta$} \bo{explain why?}

By considering a specific class of surrogate losses -- \emph{polyhedral}, generalizations of piecwise-linear convex -- we will show that this utopia is in fact achieved for every surrogate in this class.

%\begin{theorem}[Linear bounds for polyhedral surrogates]
\begin{theorem}[Main surrogate regret bound]
  \label{thm:main-upper}
  Let $L$ be any polyhedral surrogate and $\psi$ any link function such that $(L,\psi)$ is consistent for the target loss $\ell$.
  Then $(L,\psi)$ guarantee a linear regret transfer rate for $\ell$.
  %Then there exists a surrogate regret bound with a linear transfer function $\zeta$.
\end{theorem}

We will also show a class of counterexamples for surrogate losses that are far from polyhedral, i.e. those that are smooth and strongly convex.
This could be viewed as a partial converse, providing evidence that some element of ``piecewise-linearity'' is \emph{necessary} for optimal surrogate regret bounds.
\begin{theorem}[Main lower bound]
  \label{thm:main-lower}
  Let $L$ be a differentiable convex surrogate, with locally Lipschitz gradient, which is locally strongly convex.
  If $L$ satisfies a regret transfer rate of $\zeta$ for a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
%  If $\zeta$ is a transfer function in a surrogate regret bound for $L$ to a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
\end{theorem}

Surrogate regret bounds have been well studied in some settings.
It is known that $\zeta$ \raf{examples: logistic, exponential, and hinge}.
Some general bounds are known for classes of surrogates, e.g. \raf{refs}.

\section{Preliminaries}

\paragraph{Target problems.}
We consider supervised machine learning problems where data points have features in $\X$ and labels in $\Y$, a finite set.
The \emph{target problem} is to learn a hypothesis mapping $\X$ to a \emph{report} (or \emph{prediction}) \emph{space} $\R$, possibly different from $\Y$.
In this paper, we assume $\R$ is a finite set.
%For example, standard binary classification has $\Y = \R = \{-1,+1\}$, whereas in a ranking problem, $\R$ is the set of all permutations of $\Y$.
We suppose the target problem is specified by the \emph{target loss} $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, which maps a report (prediction) $r \in \R$ to the vector $\ell(r)$ of nonnegative loss values for each label, i.e. $\ell(r) = (\ell(r)_y)_{y\in\Y}$.
Given a hypothesis $g: \X \to \R$ and a data point $(x,y) \in \X \times \Y$, the loss is $\ell(g(x))_y$.
\bo{We will make a minimal non-redundancy assumption on $\ell$ in [Ref].}

\bo{given the intro, perhaps we can omit examples? but we do need to emphasize that $\R \neq \Y$ generally.}



\paragraph{Surrogate problems.}
\bo{Given the intro, this paragraph can probably be shortened.}
Because optimizing a discrete target loss on a dataset is typically intractable, the usual approach is \emph{surrogate risk minimization}.
First, one constructs a \emph{surrogate loss function} $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$.
Then, one minimizes it to learn a hypothesis of the form $h: \X \to \reals^d$.
Finally, one applies a \emph{link function} $\psi: \reals^d \to \R$ that is associated with the surrogate loss.
If the learned hypothesis predicts $h(x) \in \reals^d$, then the implied prediction for the target problem is $\psi(h(x)) \in \R$.

For example, in binary classification, the target problem is given by $0$-$1$ loss, $\ell(r)_y = \ones\{r\neq y\}$, with surrogate losses typically defined over $\reals$.
Common surrogate losses include hinge loss and logistic loss.
These surrogates are typically associated with the link $\psi(u) = \mathrm{sign}(u)$, which maps negative predictions to $-1$ and nonnegative predictions to $+1$.

\paragraph{Surrogate regret bounds.}
Given a target problem, we would like to design surrogates which efficiently solve it.
A standard tool to establish this efficiency is a \emph{surrogate regret bound}.
We define the \emph{regret} of a hypothesis $h: \X \to \reals^d$ as the expected loss relative to the best possible.
Formally, the \emph{surrogate regret} of $h$ with respect to data distribution $\D$ is given by $R_L(h;\D) = \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} L(h(X))_Y - \inf_{h':\X\to\reals^d} \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} L(h'(X))_Y$, where the minimum is taken over all measurable functions.
(One may equivalently assume the Bayes optimal hypothesis is in the function class.)
Given $h$, the \emph{target regret} of the implied hypothesis $\psi \circ h$ is $R_\ell(\psi\circ h;\D) = \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} \ell(\psi(h(X)))_Y - \inf_{h':\X\to\R} \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} \ell(h'(X))_Y$, where we recall that $\psi$ is the link function.

%% Addressed in intro instead
%A central concern for learning algorithms is the \emph{rate of convergence} of regret.
%If $h_n$ denotes an algorithm's output on $n$ data points, then a typical bound is of the form $R_L(h_n;\D) \leq O\left(\frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}\right)$, usually for some $\alpha$ between $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (``slow'') and $1$ (``fast'').
%However, such bounds for the surrogate leave open the question of the implied rate of convergence for the target problem.
%This is the question we address by studying \emph{surrogate regret bounds}.

A surrogate regret bound answers the following question: when we minimize the surrogate regret at a rate $f(n)$, given $n$ data points, how fast does the target regret diminish?
Formally, we say that $\zeta : \reals_+ \to \reals_+$ is a \emph{rate transfer function} if $\zeta$ is continuous at $0$ and satisfies $\zeta(0) = 0$.
Given a rate transfer function $\zeta$, we say that $(L,\psi)$ guarantees a \emph{regret transfer rate of $\zeta$} for $\ell$ if
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surrogate-regret-bound}
  \forall \D, \forall h:\X\to\reals^d, \quad R_\ell(\psi\circ h;\D) \leq \zeta(\, R_L(h;\D) \,)~.
\end{equation}
We note that a classic minimal requirement for $(L,\psi)$ is that they be \emph{consistent} for $\ell$, which is the case if there exists any regret transfer rate $\zeta$ guaranteed by $(L,\psi)$ for $\ell$.\bo{cite}
In other words, consistency implies that $R_L(h;\D) \to 0 \implies R_{\ell}(\psi \circ h;\D) \to 0$, but says nothing about the relative rates.

%% Addressed in intro
%However, consistency alone could be compatible with slow transfer functions such as $\zeta(\epsilon) = \epsilon^{1/4}$.
%For such transfers, a ``fast'' learning rate of e.g. $O\left(\tfrac{1}{n}\right)$ in the surrogate problem would only transfer to a very slow rate of $O\left(\tfrac{1}{n^{1/4}}\right)$ in the target.
%On the other hand, we could hope to choose surrogates with as fast as a linear transfer rate, $\zeta(\epsilon) \leq C \cdot \epsilon$, implying $R_{\ell}(\psi \circ h;\D) \leq C \cdot R_L(h;\D)$.

%% Moved to intro
%Surrogate regret bounds have been well studied in some settings.
%It is known that $\zeta$ \raf{examples: logistic, exponential, and hinge}.
%Some general bounds are known for classes of surrogates, e.g. \raf{refs}.
%Lacking, however, is a general understanding of what $\zeta$ one can expect from a surrogates, especially for arbitrary target losses.

%% Addressed in intro
%We give two main results to deepen this understanding.
%The first is that polyhedral (piecewise-linear and convex) surrogates always yield \emph{linear} regret bounds.
%The second is that sufficiently convex and smooth losses (i.e., ``non-polyhedral'') require $\zeta(\epsilon) = \Omega(\sqrt{\epsilon})$.
%

%  Let $L$ be any polyhedral surrogate and $\psi$ any link function such that $(L,\psi)$ is consistent for the target loss $\ell$.
%  Then $(L,\psi)$ guarantee a linear regret transfer rate for $\ell$.
%  %Then there exists a surrogate regret bound with a linear transfer function $\zeta$.

\paragraph{Polyhedral surrogates.}
In this paper, we consider the class of polyhedral surrogates, which includes hinge loss.\bo{And?}
Formally, a function $f: \reals^d \to \reals$ is called \emph{polyhedral} if it can be written as a pointwise maximum of a finite set of affine functions~\cite{rockafellar1997convex}.\bo{theorem/chapter?}
The epigraph of a polyhedral function is a polyhedral set, i.e. the intersection of a finite set of closed halfspaces; thus polyhedral functions are always convex.
We say a surrogate loss $L: \reals^d \to \reals_+^{\Y}$ is \emph{polyhedral} if, for each fixed $y \in \Y$, the loss as a function of prediction, i.e. $r \mapsto L(r)_y$, is polyhedral.

\subsection{Property elicitation and the conditional approach}
Our technical approach is based on property elicitation, which studies the structure of $\ell$ and $L$ as they relate to $\simplex$.
This involves a \emph{conditional} perspective.
Given a data distribution $\D$ on $\X \times \Y$, for $(X,Y) \sim \D$, we consider the format of possible target predictions $g(x) = r \in \R$; surrogate predictions $h(x) = u \in \reals^d$; and conditional distributions $\Pr[ \cdot \mid X] = p \in \simplex$.
By dropping the role of the hypotheses and the feature space $\X$, we can focus on the relationships of the functions $\ell(r)_y$ and $L(u)_y$ on the conditional distribution $p$.

In particular, the \emph{Bayes risk} of $L$ is $\risk{L}(p) = \inf_{u \in \reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}$, and similarly the Bayes risk of $\ell$ is $\risk{\ell}(p) = \inf_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{\ell(r)}$.
We abuse notation to define the \emph{conditional surrogate regret} $R_L(u,p) = \inprod{p}{L(u)} - \risk{L}(p)$, and similarly the \emph{conditional target regret} $R_{\ell}(r,p) = \inprod{p}{\ell(r)} - \risk{\ell}(p)$.
 
To begin, we define a \emph{property}, which is essentially a statistic or summary of a distribution, such as the mode.
We then define what it means for a loss function to \emph{elicit} a property.
We write $\Gamma: \simplex \toto \R$ as shorthand for $\Gamma: \simplex \to 2^{\R} \setminus \{\emptyset\}$.
We write $\inprod{p}{L(u)}$ for the expected surrogate loss of prediction $u$ on distribution $p \in \simplex$, and similarly $\inprod{p}{\ell(r)}$ is the expected target loss of $r$.




\bo{TO revisit after looking through proofs -- not sure yet how to best present this!}
\begin{definition}[Property, level set]\label{def:property}
  A \emph{property} is a function $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\R$.
  The \emph{level set} of $\Gamma$ for report $r$ is the set $\Gamma_r = \{p \in \simplex : r \in \Gamma(p)\}$.
\end{definition}
In general, a loss $f: R \to \reals^{\Y}$, for some prediction (or ``report'') space $R$, is said to \emph{elicit} a property $\Gamma$ if
\begin{equation}
  \forall p\in\simplex,\;\;\;\Gamma(p) = \argmin_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{f(r)}~.
\end{equation}

\bo{all in progress}
The following definition applies both to target losses and surrogate losses.
\begin{definition}[Elicits, report space]
  \label{def:elicits}
  A loss function $f:R\to\reals^\Y_+$, where the domain $R$ is called the \emph{report space}, \emph{elicits} a property $\Gamma:\simplex \toto \R$ if
  As each $f$ elicits a unique property, we refer to it as $\prop{f}$.
\end{definition}
In particular, we will consistently use the notation $\Gamma = \prop{L}$ where $L$ is a surrogate loss with report space $\reals^d$, and we will use $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a target loss with finite report space $\R$.

We will assume throughout that the target loss is \emph{non-redundant}, meaning that all $r \in \R$ are possibly uniquely optimal.
Formally, we suppose that for all $r \in \R$, there exists $p \in \simplex$ with $\gamma(p) = \{r\}$.

\paragraph{Calibration and consistency.}
It is known that consistency implies the weaker condition of \emph{calibration}, which implies the still-weaker, but very useful, condition of \emph{indirect elicitation}.
To define these conditions, consider $L,\psi,\ell$ and $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$.
Recall that $\gamma(p)$ of target reports that are optimal for $p$.
If $\psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)$, then $u$ is a ``bad'' (suboptimal) surrogate prediction.
Let $B_{L,\psi,\ell}(p) = \{\inprod{p}{L(u)} ~:~ \psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)\}$, the set of expected surrogate losses resulting from bad predictions.
\begin{definition}[Indirectly elicits, Calibrated]
  A surrogate-link pair $(L,\psi)$ \emph{indirectly elicits} a target $\ell$ if $0 \not\in B_{L,\psi,\ell}(p)$ for all $p \in \simplex$.
  Meanwhile, $(L,\psi)$ is \emph{calibrated} for $\ell$ if $0 < \inf B_{L,\psi,\ell}(p)$ for all $p \in \simplex$.
%  \begin{equation}
%    \inf_{u : \psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)} \inprod{p}{L(u)} > \risk{L}(p)$ .
%  \end{equation}
%  Throughout, $\Gamma = \prop{L}$ and $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$.
\end{definition}
Equivalently, $(L,\psi)$ indirectly elicits $\ell$ if $u \in \Gamma(p) \implies \psi(u) \in \gamma(p)$.
Calibration is the slightly more subtle condition that there is a nonzero gap between the expected loss of a ``good'' report and that of any bad one.
%Observe that indirect elicitation is the condition that $0 \not\in \{\inprod{p}{L(u)} ~:~ \psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)\}$.
%Calibration is the slightly stronger condition that $0$ is not the infimum of the set.
\begin{fact}[\bo{cite who?}]
  Let $\ell: \R \to \reals_+^{\Y}$ be a target loss with finite $\R$ and $\Y$.
  If a surrogate and link $(L,\psi)$ are consistent for $\ell$, then $(L,\psi)$ are calibrated for $L$.
  If $(L,\psi)$ are calibrated for $\ell$, then they indirectly elicit $\ell$.
\end{fact}

%% move to inline where used
%\begin{definition}[Embedding a loss]\label{def:loss-embed}
%  A loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$ \emph{embeds} a loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y$ if there exists some injective embedding $\varphi:\R\to\reals^d$ such that
%  (i) for all $r\in\R$ we have $L(\varphi(r)) = \ell(r)$, and (ii) for all $p\in\simplex,r\in\R$ we have
%  \begin{equation}\label{eq:embed-loss}
%    r \in \prop{\ell}(p) \iff \varphi(r) \in \prop{L}(p)~.
%  \end{equation}
%\end{definition}

\section{Upper bound: polyhedral surrogates}
In this section, we develop the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main-upper}.
At a high level, the proof has two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fix $p \in \simplex$.
        Prove that $R_{\ell}(\psi(u),p) \leq \alpha_p R_L(u,p)$ for some constant $\alpha_p$.
  \item Apply this result to a finite subset $P$ of $\simplex$, namely the vertices of the level sets of $\gamma$.
        Argue (carefully) that, because a general $p$ is a convex combination of vertices of its own level set, $R_{\ell}(\psi(u),p) \leq \left(\max_{p' \in P} \alpha_{p'}\right) R_L(u,p)$.
        This implies a linear conditional transfer rate with constant $\max_{p' \in P} \alpha_{p'}$; it immediately implies a linear transfer rate as promised.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Part 1: fixed $p$}
\bo{include this proof sketch? Maybe not!}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $L$ is polyhedral, then the set of minimizers of $\inprod{p}{L(\cdot)}$ is a nice, convex, actually polyhedral subset of $\reals^d$.
  \item In addition, expected loss increases linearly with the distance of a prediction $u$ to this set.
  \item If $(L,\psi)$ is calibrated for $\ell$, then $\psi$ must be $\epsilon$-separated (Definition \bo{ref} below): all predictions with $\epsilon$ of the optimal set must link to an optimal target prediction in $\gamma(p)$.
  \item So conditional target regret is nonzero only for surrogate predictions that are $\epsilon$-far from the optimal set, which
