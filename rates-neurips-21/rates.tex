\begin{abstract}
  In supervised machine learning, often a target problem is solved by minimizing a surrogate loss on a dataset.
  Study of convergence rates, which bound generalization error as a function of dataset size, typically neglects the relationship between the target and surrogate problems.
  We consider the transfer of rate guarantees from the surrogate loss to the target problem.
  We show that any consistent piecewise-linear convex (i.e. polyhedral) surrogate achieves a linear transfer rate, i.e. fast convergence of excess risk in the surrogate implies fast convergence in the target.
  Simple counterexamples show that transfer rates can be much slower, e.g. quadratic, when the surrogate is smooth or strongly convex.

\section{Introduction}

Machine learning is important.

Mention that the techniques focus on the ``conditional problem''.


\raf{Define regret; goal: minimize target regret}
A surrogate regret bound answers the following question: when we minimize the surrogate regret at a rate $f(n)$, given $n$ data points, how fast does the target regret diminish?
Informally a surrogate regret bound takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surrogate-regret-bound-informal}
  \forall \text{ hypotheses } h:\X\to\reals^d, \quad \mathrm{Regret}_\ell(\psi\circ h) \leq \zeta(\, \mathrm{Regret}_L(h) \,)~,
\end{equation}
where the function $\zeta : \reals_+ \to \reals_+$ controls how surrogate regret translates to target regret.
Ideally, $\zeta$ is small, giving a strong upper bound.
Of particular interest is the concavity of $\zeta$: if linear, ...., if $\sqrt{}$ then...

\begin{theorem}[Linear bounds for polyhedral]
  Let $L$ be any polyhedral surrogate and $\psi$ any link function such that $(L,\psi)$ is consistent for the target loss $\ell$.
  Then $(L,\psi)$ guarantee a linear regret transfer rate for $\ell$.
  %Then there exists a surrogate regret bound with a linear transfer function $\zeta$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Square root for non-polyhedral]
  Let $L$ be a differentiable convex surrogate, with locally Lipschitz gradient, which is locally strongly convex.
  If $L$ satisfies a regret transfer rate of $\zeta$ for a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
%  If $\zeta$ is a transfer function in a surrogate regret bound for $L$ to a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Setting}

\paragraph{Target problems.}
We consider supervised machine learning problems where data points have features in $\X$ and labels in $\Y$, a finite set.
The \emph{target problem} is to learn a hypothesis mapping $\X$ to a \emph{report} (or \emph{prediction}) \emph{space} $\R$, possibly different from $\Y$.
In this paper, we assume $\R$ is a finite set.
For example, standard binary classification has $\Y = \R = \{-1,+1\}$, whereas
% In classification with an abstain option, $\R = \Y \cup \{\bot\}$ where $\bot$ represents abstaining from choosing a label.
in a ranking problem, $\R$ is the set of all permutations of $\Y$.

We suppose the target problem is specified by the \emph{target loss} $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, which maps a report (prediction) $r \in \R$ to the vector $\ell(r)$ of nonnegative loss values for each label, i.e. $\ell(r) = (\ell(r)_y)_{y\in\Y}$.
Given a hypothesis $g: \X \to \R$ and a data point $(x,y) \in \X \times \Y$, the loss is $\ell(g(x))_y$.

\paragraph{Surrogate problems.}
Because optimizing a discrete target loss on a dataset is typically intractable, the usual approach is \emph{surrogate risk minimization}.
First, one constructs a \emph{surrogate loss function} $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$.
Then, one minimizes it to learn a hypothesis of the form $h: \X \to \reals^d$.
Finally, one applies a \emph{link function} $\psi: \reals^d \to \R$ that is associated with the surrogate loss.
If the learned hypothesis predicts $h(x) \in \reals^d$, then the implied prediction for the target problem is $\psi(h(x)) \in \R$.

For example, in binary classification, the target problem is given by $0$-$1$ loss, $\ell(r)_y = \ones\{r\neq y\}$, with surrogate losses typically defined over $\reals$.
Common surrogate losses include hinge loss and logistic loss.
These surrogates are typically associated with the link $\psi(u) = \mathrm{sign}(u)$, which maps negative predictions to $-1$ and nonnegative predictions to $+1$.

\paragraph{Surrogate regret bounds.}
Given a target problem, we would like to design surrogates which efficiently solve it.
A standard tool to establish this efficiency is a \emph{surrogate regret bound}.
We define the \emph{regret} of a hypothesis $h: \X \to \reals^d$ as the expected loss relative to the best possible.
Formally, the \emph{surrogate regret} of $h$ with respect to data distribution $\D$ is given by $R_L(h;\D) = \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} L(h(X))_Y - \inf_{h':\X\to\reals^d} \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} L(h'(X))_Y$, where the minimum is taken over all measurable functions.
(One may equivalently assume the Bayes optimal hypothesis is in the function class.)
The \emph{target regret} of $h$ is thus $R_\ell(\psi\circ h;\D) = \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} \ell(\psi(h(X)))_Y - \inf_{h':\X\to\R} \E_{(X,Y)\sim\D} \ell(h'(X))_Y$, where we recall that $\psi$ is the link function.

A central concern for learning algorithms is the \emph{rate of convergence} of regret.
If $h_n$ denotes an algorithm's output on $n$ data points, then a typical bound is of the form $R_L(h_n;\D) \leq O\left(\frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}\right)$, usually for some $\alpha$ between $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (``slow'') and $1$ (``fast'').
However, such bounds for the surrogate leave open the question of the implied rate of convergence for the target problem.

This is the question we address by studying \emph{surrogate regret bounds}.
%A surrogate regret bound answers the following question: when we minimize the surrogate regret at a rate $f(n)$, given $n$ data points, how fast does the target regret diminish?
Formally, we say that $(L,\psi)$ guarantees a \emph{regret transfer rate of $\zeta$} for $\ell$, for a function $\zeta : \reals_+ \to \reals_+$, if
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surrogate-regret-bound}
  \forall \D, \forall h:\X\to\reals^d, \quad R_\ell(\psi\circ h;\D) \leq \zeta(\, R_L(h;\D) \,)~.
\end{equation}
We will refer to $\zeta$ as the \emph{rate transfer function} and require that $\zeta$ be continuous at $0$ with $\zeta(0)=0$.
%A minimal requirement is that $(L,\psi)$ is \emph{consistent} with $\ell$, meaning $\zeta$ is continuous at $0$ and satisfies $\zeta(0) = 0$.

As a classic minimal requirement \bo{cite}, $(L,\psi)$ are \emph{consistent} for $\ell$ if there exists any regret transfer rate $\zeta$ guaranteed by $(L,\psi)$ for $\ell$.
However, consistency alone could be compatible with slow transfer functions such as $\zeta(\epsilon) = \epsilon^{1/4}$.
For such transfers, a ``fast'' learning rate of e.g. $O\left(\tfrac{1}{n}\right)$ in the surrogate problem would only transfer to a very slow rate of $O\left(\tfrac{1}{n^{1/4}}\right)$ in the target.
On the other hand, we could hope to choose surrogates with as fast as a linear transfer rate, $\zeta(\epsilon) \leq C \cdot \epsilon$, implying $R_{\ell}(\psi \circ h;\D) \leq C \cdot R_L(h;\D)$.

\bo{I wonder if this paragraph can go elsewhere...}
Surrogate regret bounds have been well studied in some settings.
It is known that $\zeta$ \raf{examples: logistic, exponential, and hinge}.
Some general bounds are known for classes of surrogates, e.g. \raf{refs}.
Lacking, however, is a general understanding of what $\zeta$ one can expect from a surrogates, especially for arbitrary target losses.

We give two main results to deepen this understanding.
The first is that polyhedral (piecewise-linear and convex) surrogates always yield \emph{linear} regret bounds.
The second is that sufficiently convex and smooth losses (i.e., ``non-polyhedral'') require $\zeta(\epsilon) = \Omega(\sqrt{\epsilon})$.

\begin{theorem}[Main surrogate regret bound]
  Let $L$ be any polyhedral surrogate and $\psi$ any link function such that $(L,\psi)$ is consistent for the target loss $\ell$.
  Then $(L,\psi)$ guarantee a linear regret transfer rate for $\ell$.
  %Then there exists a surrogate regret bound with a linear transfer function $\zeta$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Main counterexample]
  Let $L$ be a differentiable convex surrogate, with locally Lipschitz gradient, which is locally strongly convex.
  If $L$ satisfies a regret transfer rate of $\zeta$ for a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
%  If $\zeta$ is a transfer function in a surrogate regret bound for $L$ to a target loss $\ell$, then there exists $c>0$ such that, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, we have $\zeta(\epsilon) \geq c\cdot\sqrt{\epsilon}$.
\end{theorem}

\raf{Paragraph on implication for rates here.  Maybe Huber example?}


\paragraph{Polyhedral surrogates.}
We say a surrogate $L$ is \emph{polyhedral} if it is piecewise linear and convex.
To introduce this definition more formally, let us recall some definitions from convex geometry.
In $\reals^d$, a \emph{polyhedral set} or \emph{polyhedron} is the intersection of a finite number of closed halfspaces.
% A \emph{polytope} is a bounded polyhedral set.
A convex function $f:\reals^d\to\reals$ is \emph{polyhedral} if its epigraph is polyhedral, or equivalently, if it can be written as a pointwise maximum of a finite set of affine functions~\cite{rockafellar1997convex}.

\begin{definition}[Polyhedral loss]
  A loss $L: \reals^d \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ is \emph{polyhedral} if $L(u)_y$ is a polyhedral (convex) function of $u$ for each $y\in\Y$.
  \bo{Can we omit ``(convex)''?}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Property elicitation and consistency}
Our technical approach is based on property elicitation, which studies the structure of $\ell$ and $L$ as they relate to $\simplex$.
In the below, $\Gamma: \simplex \toto \R$ is shorthand for $\Gamma: \simplex \to 2^{\R} \setminus \{\emptyset\}$.

\begin{definition}[Property, level set]\label{def:property}
  A \emph{property} is a function $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\R$.
  The \emph{level set} of $\Gamma$ for report $r$ is the set $\Gamma_r = \{p \in \simplex : r \in \Gamma(p)\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Elicits]
  \label{def:elicits}
  A loss $L:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, \emph{elicits} a property $\Gamma:\simplex \toto \R$ if
  \begin{equation}
    \forall p\in\simplex,\;\;\;\Gamma(p) = \argmin_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{L(r)}~.
  \end{equation}
  As $L$ elicits a unique property, we write $\prop{L}$ to refer to the property elicited by a loss $L$.
\end{definition}

\bo{Wrap this in an Assumption environment. I didn't think it fit well above...} We will assume throughout that the target loss is \emph{non-redundant}, meaning every report $r \in \R$ is uniquely optimal (uniquely minimizes expected loss) for some distribution $p\in\simplex$.

\begin{definition}[Embedding a loss]\label{def:loss-embed}
  A loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$ \emph{embeds} a loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y$ if there exists some injective embedding $\varphi:\R\to\reals^d$ such that
  (i) for all $r\in\R$ we have $L(\varphi(r)) = \ell(r)$, and (ii) for all $p\in\simplex,r\in\R$ we have
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:embed-loss}
    r \in \prop{\ell}(p) \iff \varphi(r) \in \prop{L}(p)~.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
