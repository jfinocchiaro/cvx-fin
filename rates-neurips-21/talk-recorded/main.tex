  This paper: \textbf{polyhedral surrogates}  \hintright{piecewise-linear and convex}
  \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
    \item \emph{All} polyhedral surrogates have \textbf{linear} regret transfer rates!
    \item \emph{All} sufficiently ``non-polyhedral'' surrogate transfers are \textbf{quadratically slower}.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Polyhedral:} \redem{Surrogate regret} $\leq \epsilon$ $\implies$ \blueem{target regret} $\leq O(\epsilon)$  \\
  \pause \textbf{Non-polyhedral:} Sometimes, \redem{surrogate regret} $\leq \epsilon$ yet \blueem{target regret} $\geq \Omega(\sqrt{\epsilon})$.
