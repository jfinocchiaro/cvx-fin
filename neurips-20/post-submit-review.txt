line 26- prediction and sample complexity to prediction
lin 30- split citations into discrete and continuous
line 33- elaborate on difficulty of "challenging to work with"
line 46- for ___, for ___ change
line 54- emphasize \Y is finite, and n = |\Y|.
line 67- means approximately minimizing L corresponds to approximately minimizing \ell
line 78- add visualization of four quadrants?
line 82- cite specific result instead of section
line 95- property can be empty, where it can't be in the rest of the paper.  also, might want consistency (no pun intended) in the \toto \R vs \to 2^\R notation.
line 116- elaborate/intuit more about indirect elicitation if space.
line 154- "construct a calibrated link functions"

Left off at Section 3.

general thought: 
relationship between calibrated surrogate (wrt \ell eliciting \gamma) and existence of surrogate L in \L indirectly eliciting \gamma?
