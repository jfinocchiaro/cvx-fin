Dear Editors:

We are writing to submit our manuscript ``An Embedding Framework for the Design and Analysis of Consistent Polyhedral Surrogates'' to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Our manuscript studies \red{the design of consistent piecewise linear and convex surrogates for general discrete prediction tasks} which is important because \red{this is the first framework to our knowledge that characterizes consistent and convex surrogates for general prediction tasks.  Convex surrogates for prediction tasks are often design in an ad-hoc manner, and as a result are often not actually consistent for the prediction task at hand.}

This paper extends our works of \red{An Embedding Framework for Consistent Polyhedral Surrogates} and \red{Surrogate Regret Bounds for Polyhedral Losses} by \red{adding results connecting our proposed embedding framework to indirect elicitation, adding more examples and giving new results about their surrogate regret bounds, and fully establishing when a convex surrogate embeds a discrete loss, among others}.

We suggest the following action editors and referees for our submission.

Action Editors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Sanmi Koyejo, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (sanmi@illinois.edu)}

\end{itemize}

Reviewers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Bob Williamson, University of T\"ubingen (bob.williamson @uni-tuebingen.de )}

    \item \red{First Lastname, Institution (first.lastname@institution.edu)}
    \item \red{First Lastname, Institution (first.lastname@institution.edu)}
\end{itemize}

Our submission has the following keywords: \red{Surrogate loss function}, \red{Statistical (FISHER? UNIVERSAL?) consistency}, \red{keyword}, \red{keyword}, \red{keyword}.

As the corresponding author, I confirm that none of the co-authors listed below have a conflict of interest with the action editors and referees I suggest above. Further, I confirm that all co-authors below consent to my submission of this manuscript to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.
