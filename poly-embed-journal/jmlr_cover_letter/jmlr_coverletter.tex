Dear Editors:

We are writing to submit our manuscript ``An Embedding Framework for the Design and Analysis of Consistent Polyhedral Surrogates'' to the \emph{Journal of Machine Learning Research}.

Our manuscript proposes a new framework to design consistent convex surrogates for general discrete prediction tasks.
As convex surrogates are often designed in an ad-hoc manner, and often are inconsistent for the desired target task, our framework fills a urgent gap in the literature.

Our manuscript extends the conference publication \emph{An Embedding Framework for Consistent Polyhedral Surrogates} (NeurIPS 2019) and incorporates roughly half the results from \emph{Surrogate Regret Bounds for Polyhedral Losses} (NeurIPS 2021).
We have substantially rewritten and reorganized these papers, as well as adding entirely new results (\S 6, \S 7, \S E).
For example, \S 6 shows the equivalence of several natural notions of non-redundancy, and \S 7 uses our framework to show that indirect elicitation is equivalent to consistency for polyhedral surrogates.

We suggest the following action editors, referees, and keywords for our submission.

Action Editors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ambuj Tewari, University of Michigan (\url{tewaria@umich.edu})
    \item Sanmi Koyejo, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (\url{sanmi@illinois.edu})
    \item Moritz Hardt, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\"ubingen (\url{hardt@is.mpg.de})

\end{itemize}

Reviewers:

    \item First Lastname, Institution (first.lastname@institution.edu)
    \item First Lastname, Institution (first.lastname@institution.edu)
\end{itemize}

Keywords: Statistical consistency, surrogate loss functions, calibration, property elicitation, embeddings.
