Main Thm: Show: for all r, r': for all p such that r' in gamma(p), we have
inf_{u : psi(u) = r} L(u;p) - L(u*;p) >= delta * [ ell(r;p) - ell(r';p) ]

Proof: fix p_canon in interior of gamma_{r'}
Fix p_bd on boundary
Show exists v such that inf_{u: psi(u) = r} L(u;p) - L(u*;p) >= v*p for all p between p_canon and p_bd
Implies there exists delta > 0 such that inf_{u: psi(u) = r} L(u;p) - L(u*;p) >= delta * [ell(r;p) - ell(r';p)]
Argue that p_bd comes from a closed set, so the inf over these delta is achieved at some delta > 0.


Weaker lemma: Given r, r', p_canon, p_bd: show exists v such that
inf_{u: psi(u) = r} L(u;p) - L(u*;p) >= v*p
p*v > 0 for p in gamma_{r'} \ gamma_r
p*v = 0 for p in gamma_{r'} \cap gamma_r .
(for all p between p_canon and p_bd)
Improved weaker lemma: case on p_bd in gamma_r or not.
