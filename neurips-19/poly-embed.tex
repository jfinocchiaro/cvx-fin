\begin{abstract}
We formalize and study the natural approach of designing convex surrogate loss functions via embeddings for problems such as classification or ranking. In this approach, one embeds each of the finitely many predictions (e.g. classes) as a point in $\reals^d$, assigns the original loss values to these points, and convexifies the loss in some way to obtain a surrogate.
We prove that this approach is equivalent, in a strong sense, to working with polyhedral (piecewise linear convex) losses.
Moreover, given any polyhedral loss $L$, we give a construction of a link function through which $L$ is a consistent surrogate for the loss it embeds.
We go on to illustrate the power of this embedding framework with succinct proofs of consistency or inconsistency of various polyhedral surrogates in the literature.
\end{abstract}

%  Convex surrogates are sweet.
%  Given a loss for a classification-like problem, there are two natural approaches to design convex surrogates.
%  First, one may attempt to map each prediction to a low-dimensional vector, and try to find a convex loss in that space with the right calibration.
%  Second, one may simply try to find a surrogate within the class of piecewise-linear convex, or polyhedral, losses.
%  We show an equivalence between these two approaches, and \raf{more stuff}.
%  We show that every loss with a finite number of predictions has a convex surrogate in the above sense using one fewer dimension that the number of outcomes, and give a full characterization of the losses needing only $d$ dimensions for such a surrogate.
%  We then apply this characterization to show novel lower bounds for abstain loss, demonstrating the power of our techniques over \raf{check this} alternatives such as feasible subspace dimension.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%\raf{MOVED FROM SEC 2; maybe incorporate?}
%Often, for computational or other reasons, one is interested in a property $\gamma$ such as the mode, but wishes to elicit it by minimizing some other ``surrogate'' loss $L$ over some other space such as $\reals^d$, then mapping the result back to $\R$ using a link function.
%We now formalize this procedure.
%

Convex surrogate losses are a central building block in machine learning for classification and classification-like problems.
A growing body of work seeks to design and analyze convex surrogates for given loss functions, and more broadly, understand when such surrogates can and cannot be found.
For example, recent work has developed tools to bound the required number of dimensions of the surrogate's hypothesis space~\cite{frongillo2015elicitation,  ramaswamy2016convex}.
Yet in some cases these bounds are far from tight, such as for \emph{abstain loss} (classification with an abstain option)~\cite{bartlett2008classification, yuan2010classification, ramaswamy2016convex, ramaswamy2018consistent, zhang2018reject}.
Furthermore, the kinds of strategies available for constructing surrogates, and their relative power, are not well-understood.

We augment this literature by studying a particularly natural approach for finding convex surrogates, wherein one ``embeds'' a discrete loss.
Specifically, we say a convex surrogate $L$ embeds a discrete loss $\ell$ if there is an injective embedding from the discrete reports (predictions) to a vector space such that (i) the original loss values are recovered, and (ii) a report is $\ell$-optimal if and only if the embedded report is $L$-optimal.
If this embedding can be extended to a calibrated link function, which maps approximately $L$-optimal reports to $\ell$-optimal reports, then consistency follows~\cite{agarwal2015consistent}.
Common examples of this general construction include hinge loss as a surrogate for 0-1 loss and the abstain surrogate mentioned above.

Using tools from property elicitation, we show a tight relationship between such embeddings and the class of polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) loss functions.
In particular, by focusing on Bayes risks, we show that every discrete loss is embedded by some polyhedral loss, and every polyhedral loss function embeds some discrete loss.
Moreover, we show that any polyhedral loss gives rise to a calibrated link function to the loss it embeds,
thus giving a very general framework to construct consistent convex surrogates for arbitrary losses.

%\jessie{Take out this paragraph?}
%We go on to initiate a study of \emph{embedding dimension}: the minimal dimension for a given discrete loss to be so embedded.
%Our results give a complete characterization in the case of dimension 1; that is, real-valued surrogates.
%We find that a discrete loss can be embedded in the real line if and only if it is order-sensitive, meaning there is an ordering of the predictions such that the loss increases as one moves away from the correct prediction.
%We show further that order-sensitivity characterizes the existence of \emph{any} real-valued convex surrogate, implying that embeddings lose no generality.
%We conclude with preliminary results in higher dimensions and other future directions.

\paragraph{Related works.}
The literature on convex surrogates focuses mainly on smooth surrogate losses~\cite{crammer2001algorithmic,bartlett2006convexity,bartlett2008classification, duchi2018multiclass, williamson2016composite, reid2010composite}.
Nevertheless, nonsmooth losses, such as the polyhedral losses we consider, have been proposed and studied for a variety of classification-like problems~\cite{yang2018consistency,yu2018lovasz,lapin2015top}.
%\jessiet{Do we want the SVM (Boser) cite?}\raft{Basically anything we talk about in the examples. removed hari from this link since we mention it next}
A notable addition to this literature is~\citet{ramaswamy2018consistent}, who argue that nonsmooth losses may enable dimension reduction of the prediction space (range of the surrogate hypothesis) relative to smooth losses, illustrating this conjecture with a surrogate for \emph{abstain loss} needing only $\log n$ dimensions for $n$ labels, whereas the best known smooth loss needs $n-1$.
Their surrogate is a natural example of an embedding (cf.~Section~\ref{sec:abstain}), and serves as inspiration for our work.

While property elicitation has by now an extensive literature~\cite{savage1971elicitation,osband1985information-eliciting,lambert2008eliciting,gneiting2011making,steinwart2014elicitation,frongillo2015vector-valued,fissler2016higher,lambert2018elicitation}\raft{others? already a bit much...}, these works are mostly concerned with point estimation problems.
Literature directly connecting property elicitation to consistency is sparse, with the main reference being~\citet{agarwal2015consistent}; note however that they consider single-valued properties, whereas properties elicited by general convex losses are necessarily set-valued.

% \citet{agarwal2015consistent} and~\citet{ramaswamy2016convex} study the existence of convex surrogates; the latter proves lower bounds on dimensionality of hypothesis spaces for e.g.~0-1 loss via their notion of feasible subspace dimension.
%   These works are generally not directly comparable to our results, as they do not consider the embedding method.
%   However, we will mention relevant results inline.


\section{Setting}
\label{sec:setting}

For discrete prediction problems like classification, due to hardness of directly optimizing a given discrete loss, many machine learning algorithms can be thought of as minimizing a surrogate loss function with better optimization qualities, e.g., convexity.
Of course, to show that this surrogate loss successfully addresses the original problem, one needs to establish consistency, which depends crucially on the choice of link function that maps surrogate reports (predictions) to original reports.
After introducing notation, and terminology from property elicitation, we thus give a sufficient condition for consistency (Def.~\ref{def:calibrated}) which depends solely on the conditional distribution over $\Y$.

\subsection{Notation and Losses}
\label{sec:notation-losses}

Let $\Y$ be a finite outcome (label) space, and throughout let $n=|\Y|$.
The set of probability distributions on $\Y$ is denoted $\simplex\subseteq\reals^{\Y}$, represented as vectors of probabilities.
We write $p_y$ for the probability of outcome $y \in \Y$ drawn from $p \in \simplex$.
\raft{ADDED}
We first discuss the conditional setting, with just labels $\Y$ and no features $\X$, and show in \S~\ref{sec:links-embeddings} how these notions relate to the usual $\X\times\Y$ setting.

We assume that a given discrete prediction problem, such as classification, is given in the form of a \emph{discrete loss} $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, which maps a report (prediction) $r$ from a finite set $\R$ to the vector of loss values $\ell(r) = (\ell(r)_y)_{y\in\Y}$ for each possible outcome $y\in\Y$.
We will assume throughout that the given discrete loss is \emph{non-redundant}, meaning every report is uniquely optimal (minimizes expected loss) for some distribution $p\in\simplex$.
Similarly, surrogate losses will be written $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$, typically with reports written $u\in\reals^d$.
\btw{Cut generic loss}%(A generic loss will be written $L:\R\to\reals^\Y$.)
We write the corresponding expected loss when $Y \sim p$ as $\inprod{p}{\ell(r)}$ and $\inprod{p}{L(u)}$.
The \emph{Bayes risk} of a loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$ is the function $\risk{L}:\simplex\to\reals_+$ given by $\risk{L}(p) := \inf_{u\in\reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}$; naturally for discrete losses we write $\risk{\ell}$ (and the infimum is over $\R$).

%\jessie{In general, we shall denote discrete reports by $r \in \R$, and real-valued reports by $u \in \U$.}
For example, 0-1 loss is a discrete loss with $\R = \Y = \{-1,1\}$
given by $\ellzo(r)_y = \Ind{r \neq y}$, with Bayes risk $\risk{\ellzo}(p) = 1-\max_{y\in\Y} p_y$.
Two important surrogates for $\ellzo$ are hinge loss $\hinge(u)_y = (1-yu)_+$, where $(x)_+ = \max(x,0)$, and logistic loss $L(u)_y = \log(1+\exp(-yu))$ for $u\in\reals$.

Most of the surrogates $L$ we consider will be \emph{polyhedral}, meaning piecewise linear and convex; we therefore briefly recall the relevant definitions.
In $\reals^d$, a \emph{polyhedral set} or \emph{polyhedron} is the intersection of a finite number of closed halfspaces.
A \emph{polytope} is a bounded polyhedral set.
A convex function $f:\reals^d\to\reals$ is \emph{polyhedral} if its epigraph is polyhedral, or equivalently, if it can be written as a pointwise maximum of a finite set of affine functions~\citep{rockafellar1997convex}.
%
\begin{definition}[Polyhedral loss]
  A loss $L: \reals^d \to \reals^{\Y}_+$ is \emph{polyhedral} if $L(u)_y$ is a polyhedral (convex) function of $u$ for each $y\in\Y$.
\end{definition}
%
For example, hinge loss is polyhedral, whereas logistic loss is not.
\raft{ADDED}
To motivate our focus on polyhedral losses, we echo Ramaswamy et al.~\cite[Section 1.2]{ramaswamy2018consistent}, who note that smooth surrogates often encode much more information than necessary, and in these cases non-smooth surrogates are the only candidates to achieve a low dimension $d$ above.

\subsection{Property Elicitation}
\label{sec:property-elicitation}

To make headway, we will appeal to concepts and results from the property elicitation literature, which elevates the \emph{property}, or map from distributions to optimal reports, as a central object to study in its own right.
In our case, this map will often be multivalued, meaning a single distribution could yield multiple optimal reports.
(For example, when $p=(1/2,1/2)$, both $r=1$ and $r=-1$ optimize 0-1 loss.)
To this end, we will use double arrow notation to mean a mapping to all nonempty subsets, so that $\gamma: \simplex \toto \R$ is shorthand for $\Gamma: \simplex \to 2^{\R} \setminus \emptyset$.
See the discussion following Definition~\ref{def:elicits} for conventions regarding $\R$, $\Gamma$, $\gamma$, $L$, $\ell$, etc.

\begin{definition}[Property, level set]\label{def:property}
  A \emph{property} is a function $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\R$.
  The \emph{level set} of $\Gamma$ for report $r$ is the set $\Gamma_r := \{p : r \in \Gamma(p)\}$.
\end{definition}

% \raf{I am not sure this is the place to clarify these connections.  I added a forward reference to \S~\ref{sec:links-embeddings} at the top of this section, saying we'll move to the $\X\times\Y$ setting then, and I wonder if that's all we need to do.  If we want to do more, I think \S~\ref{sec:links-embeddings} would be the place to do it.  E.g.\ we can discuss $\Gamma(\Pr[Y\mid X=x])$ and $\gamma$, etc., using the notation at the end of \S~\ref{sec:property-elicitation}.  Jessie, feel free to give it a shot.}
% \jessie{I think the forward reference is enough.  We told a reviewer we would clarify what reports are, but that also might be as simple as clarifying report = prediction.}
% \proposedadd{When we discuss \emph{reports}, we are talking about the prediction yielded by $h(x)$ for the learned hypothesis function $h : \X \to \R$ over the input space $\X$.  In this case, we can think of $p$ as the conditional probability $p = Pr[Y = y | X = x]$ when the true distribution is over $\X \times\Y$.  Throughout, we abstract away the input $X \sim \X$ and can work with these conditional probabilities $p \in \simplex$.}
Intuitively, $\Gamma(p)$ is the set of reports which should be optimal for a given distribution $p$, and $\Gamma_r$ is the set of distributions for which the report $r$ should be optimal.
\btw{Finite property note commented out}%(Note that our definitions align such that discrete losses elicit finite properties; both are non-redundant in the correct senses.)
For example, the \emph{mode} is the %finite
property $\mode(p) = \argmax_{y\in\Y} p_y$, and captures the set of optimal reports for 0-1 loss: for each distribution over the labels, one should report the most likely label.
In this case we say 0-1 loss \emph{elicits} the mode, as we formalize below.
% This terminology comes from the information elicitation \jessiet{information vs property... do we care?}\raft{we could also say economics literature; not ``property'' though since that doesn't offer an explanation of the word ``elicits''} literature~\citep{savage1971elicitation,osband1985information-eliciting,lambert2008eliciting}, in which a report $r$ is elicited from some forecaster by scoring her with a loss on the observed outcome $y$.

\begin{definition}[Elicits]
  \label{def:elicits}
  A loss $L:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, \emph{elicits} a property $\Gamma:\simplex \toto \R$ if
  \begin{equation}
    \forall p\in\simplex,\;\;\;\Gamma(p) = \argmin_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{L(r)}~.
  \end{equation}
  As $\Gamma$ is uniquely defined by $L$, we write $\prop{L}$ to refer to the property elicited by a loss $L$.
\end{definition}

For finite properties (those with $|\R|<\infty$) and discrete losses, we will use lowercase notation $\gamma$ and $\ell$, respectively, with reports $r\in\R$; for surrogate properties and losses we use $\Gamma$ and $L$, with reports $u\in\reals^d$.
% For finite properties (those with $|\R|<\infty$) and discrete losses, we will use lowercase notation $\gamma:\simplex\toto\R$ and $\ell:\R\toto\reals^\Y_+$, respectively, with reports $r\in\R$; for surrogate properties and losses we use $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\reals^d$ and $L:\reals^d\toto\reals^\Y_+$, with reports $u\in\reals^d$.
For general properties and losses, we will also use $\Gamma$ and $L$, as above.

% Often we will work with two properties simultaneously, a finite property $\gamma:\simplex\toto\R$, and its embedded version $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\reals^d$.
% In this case, we write the embedded reports as $u\in\reals^d$, reserving $r\in\R$ for the finite property.

\subsection{Links and Embeddings}
\label{sec:links-embeddings}

To assess whether a surrogate and link function align with the original loss, we turn to the common condition of \emph{calibration}.
Roughly, a surrogate and link are calibrated if the best possible expected loss achieved by linking to an incorrect report is strictly suboptimal.
\btw{Separated stuff commented out}
% , which require that the excess loss of some report is bounded by (a constant times) the excess loss of the linked report.

% \begin{definition}[Consistency]\label{def:consistency}
%   A surrogate $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$ and link $\psi:\reals^d\to\R$ is \emph{consistent} with a discrete loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$ if \raf{statement about distributions on $\X\times\Y$, limits of hypotheses, and Bayes opt hypotheses}
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[Separated Link]\label{def:links}
%   Let discrete loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$ and surrogate $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$ be given.
%   A \emph{link function} is a map $\psi:\reals^d\to\R$.
%   We say that a link $\psi$ is \emph{$\delta$-separated} for some $\delta > 0$ if for all $p \in \simplex$ and $u\in\reals^d$, we have
%   \begin{align*}
%     \inprod{p}{L(u)} - \inf_{u' \in \reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u')} \geq \delta\left(\inprod{p}{\ell(\psi(u))} - \min_{r \in \R} \inprod{p}{\ell(r)}\right)~.
%   \end{align*}
%   A link is \emph{separated} if it is $\delta$-separated for some $\delta>0$.
% \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:calibrated}
  Let original loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, proposed surrogate $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$, and link function $\psi:\reals^d\to\R$ be given.
  We say $(L,\psi)$ is \emph{calibrated} with respect to $\ell$ if
for all $p \in \simplex$,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:calibrated}
  \inf_{u \in \reals^d : \psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)} \inprod{p}{L(u)} > \inf_{u \in \reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}~.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
It is well-known that calibration implies \emph{consistency}, in the following sense (cf.~\cite{agarwal2015consistent}).
Given feature space $\X$, fix a distribution $D \in \Delta(\X\times\Y)$.
Let $L^*$ be the best possible expected $L$-loss achieved by any hypothesis $H:\X\to\reals^d$, and $\ell^*$ the best expected $\ell$-loss for any hypothesis $h:\X\to\R$, respectively.
Then $(L,\psi)$ is consistent if a sequence of surrogate hypotheses $H_1,H_2,\ldots$ whose $L$-loss limits to $L^*$, then the $\ell$-loss of $\psi\circ H_1,\psi \circ H_2, \ldots$ limits to $\ell^*$.
As Definition~\ref{def:calibrated} does not involve the feature space $\X$, we will drop it for the remainder of the paper.

Several consistent convex surrogates in the literature can be thought of as ``embeddings'', wherein one maps the discrete reports to a vector space, and finds a convex loss which agrees with the original loss.
A key condition is that the original reports should be optimal exactly when the corresponding embedded points are optimal.
We formalize this notion as follows.
%
\begin{definition}\label{def:loss-embed}
  A loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$ \emph{embeds} a loss $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y$ if there exists some injective embedding $\varphi:\R\to\reals^d$ such that
  (i) for all $r\in\R$ we have $L(\varphi(r)) = \ell(r)$, and (ii) for all $p\in\simplex,r\in\R$ we have
  % \begin{equation}\label{eq:embed-loss}
  %   r \in \argmin_{r'\in\R} \inprod{p}{\ell(r')} \iff \varphi(r) \in \argmin_{u\in\reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}~.
  % \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:embed-loss}
    r \in \prop{\ell}(p) \iff \varphi(r) \in \prop{L}(p)~.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
%

Note that it is not clear if embeddings give rise to calibrated links; indeed, apart from mapping the embedded points back to their original reports via $\psi(\varphi(r)) = r$, how to map the remaining values is far from clear.
We address the question of when embeddings lead to calibrated links in Section~\ref{sec:calibration}.
%\bo{I think in Section \ref{sec:calibration} ?}


To illustrate the idea of embedding, let us examine hinge loss in detail as a surrogate for 0-1 loss for binary classification.
Recall that we have $\R = \Y = \{-1, +1\}$, with $\hinge(u)_y = (1 - uy)_+$ and $\ellzo(r)_y := \Ind{r\neq y}$, typically with link function $\psi(u) = \sgn(u)$.
We will see that hinge loss embeds (2 times) 0-1 loss, via the embedding $\varphi(r) = r$.
For condition (i), it is straightforward to check that $\hinge(r)_y = 2\ellzo(r)_y$ for all $r,y\in\{-1,1\}$.
% First, consider that
% \begin{align*}
% 	\ellzo(-1) = (0,1) && \ellzo(1) = (1,0)\\
% 	L_{hinge}(-1) = (0,2) && L_{hinge}(1) = (2,0)\\
% \end{align*}
% Therefore, $L_{hinge}$ is twice $\ellzo$ for each $r \in \R$.
For condition (ii), let us compute the property each loss elicits, i.e., the set of optimal reports for each $p$:
\[
\prop{\ellzo}(p) = \begin{cases}
1 & p_1 > 1/2 \\
\{-1,1\} & p_1 = 1/2\\
-1 & p_1 < 1/2
\end{cases}
\qquad
\prop{L_{hinge}}(p) = \begin{cases}
[1,\infty) & p_1 = 1\\
1 & p_1 \in (1/2,1) \\
[-1,1] & p_1 = 1/2\\
-1& p_1 \in (0, 1/2)\\
(-\infty, -1]& p_1 = 0
\end{cases}~.
\]
% Now, take the embedding $\varphi$ to be the identity.  % := r$ if $r \in [-1,1]$, and $\sgn(r)$ otherwise.
In particular, we see that $-1 \in \prop{\ellzo}(p) \iff p_1 \in [0, 1/2] \iff -1 \in \prop{\hinge}(p)$, and $1 \in \prop{\ellzo}(p) \iff p_1 \in [1/2,1] \iff 1 \in \prop{\hinge}(p)$.
With both conditions of Definition~\ref{def:loss-embed} satisfied, we conclude that $\hinge$ embeds $2\ellzo$.
In this particular case, it is known $(\hinge,\psi)$ is calibrated for $\psi(u) = \sgn(u)$; in Section~\ref{sec:calibration} we show that, perhaps surprisingly, all embeddings lead to calibration with an appropriate link.

% Taking $\R = \{-1,1\}$ and the above embedding, we can write the expected loss over each report
% \begin{center}
% 	\begin{tabular}{ll}
% 		$\inprod{p}{\ellzo(1)} = (1-p_1)$ & $\inprod{p}{\ellzo(-1)} = (p_1)$\\
% 		$\inprod{p}{L_{hinge}(1)} = 2(1-p_1)$ & $\inprod{p}{L_{hinge}(-1)} = 2(p_1)$
% 	\end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% Thus, for every $r \in \R$ and $p \in \simplex$, we have $2 \inprod{p}{\ellzo(r)} = \inprod{p}{L_{hinge}(\varphi(r))}$.
% This leads us into the next section, where we show the Bayes Risks of the losses will be the same, accounting for the multiplicative constant, if one loss embeds the other.

% Additionally, one can see logistic loss does not embed $\ellzo$ because it elicits a continuous property, so there is an infinite set of unique optima over $\simplex$, and thus no injection exists mapping this set to $\{-1,1\}$.

% \raf{$L_{logistic}(u,y) := \ln\left(1 + \exp(-yu)\right)$}




% In another example, we consider the abstain loss and an embedding given by Ramaswamy et al.~\cite{ramaswamy2018consistent} in Section~\ref{sec:examples}, but note that the link function they provide is not unique.
% Essentially, the discrete abstain$(1/2)$ loss is minimized in expectation by predicting the most likely outcome $\argmax_y p_y$, conditioned on $p_y \geq 1/2$.
% If the most likely outcome is not likely enough, the loss is minimized by ``abstaining'' from predicting; a situation one can imagine would be useful if a false positive is costly.





\section{Embeddings and Polyhedral Losses}
\label{sec:poly-loss-embed}

In this section, we establish a tight relationship between the technique of embedding and the use of polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses.
We defer to the following section the question of when such surrogates are consistent.

To begin, we observe that our embedding condition in Definition~\ref{def:loss-embed} is equivalent to merely matching Bayes risks.
% For example, one can check that $\risk{\hinge} = 2\min\{p_1,p_2\} = 2\risk{\ellzo}$.
This useful fact will drive many of our results.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:embed-bayes-risks}
  A loss $L$ embeds discrete loss $\ell$ if and only if $\risk{L}=\risk{\ell}$.
  % A loss $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y$ embeds discrete $\ell:\R\to\reals^Y$ if and only if $\risk{L}=\risk{\ell}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Throughout we have $L:\reals^d\to\reals^\Y_+$, $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$, and define $\Gamma = \prop{L}$ and $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$.
  Suppose $L$ embeds $\ell$ via the embedding $\varphi$.
%  Let $\Gamma = \prop{L}$ and $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$.
  Letting $\U := \varphi(\R)$, define $\gamma':\simplex \toto \U$ by $\gamma' : p \mapsto \Gamma(p)\cap \U$.
  To see that $\gamma'(p) \neq \emptyset$ for all $p\in\simplex$, note that by the definition of $\gamma$ as the property elicited by $\ell$ we have some $r \in \gamma(p)$, and by the embedding condition~\eqref{eq:embed-loss}, $\varphi(r) \in \Gamma(p)$.
  By \cite[Lemma 3]{finocchiaro2019embedding}, we see that $L|_{\U}$ (the loss $L$ with reports restricted to $\U$) elicits $\gamma'$ and $\risk{L} = \risk{L|_{\U}}$.
  As $L(\varphi(\cdot)) = \ell(\cdot)$ by the embedding, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \risk{\ell}(p) = \min_{r \in \R}\inprod{p}{\ell(r)} = \min_{r \in \R}\inprod{p}{L(\varphi(r))} = \min_{u \in \U}\inprod{p}{L(u)} = \risk{L|_\U}~,
  \end{equation*}
  for all $p\in\simplex$.
  Combining with the above, we now have $\risk{L} = \risk{\ell}$.

    \btw{RF: This is on the informal side, mostly because of the ``working in the affine hull'' bit.  It can all be formalized though, probably should be for the journal version: just take an appropriate linear projection of $\reals^n$ to $\reals^{n-1}$, and work with the projected versions of everything, and then project back.}
  For the reverse implication, assume that $\risk{L} = \risk{\ell}$.
  In what follows, we implicitly work in the affine hull of $\simplex$, so that interiors are well-defined, and $\risk{\ell}$ may be differentiable on the (relative) interior of $\simplex$.
  Since $\ell$ is discrete, $-\risk{\ell}$ is polyhedral as the pointwise maximum of a finite set of linear functions.
  The projection of its epigraph $E_\ell$ onto $\simplex$ forms a power diagram by~\cite{aurenhammer1987power}, whose cells are full-dimensional and correspond to the level sets $\gamma_r$ of $\gamma = \prop{\ell}$.

  For each $r\in\R$, let $p_r$ be a distribution in the interior of $\gamma_r$, and let $u_r \in \Gamma(p)$.
  Observe that, by definition of the Bayes risk and $\Gamma$, for all $u\in\reals^d$ the hyperplane $v \mapsto \inprod{v}{-L(u_r)}$ supports the epigraph $E_L$ of $-\risk{L}$ at the point $(p,-\inprod{p}{L(u)})$ if and only if $u\in\Gamma(p)$.
  Thus, the hyperplane $v \mapsto \inprod{v}{-L(u_r)}$ supports $E_L = E_\ell$ at the point $(p_r,-\inprod{p_r}{L(u_r)})$, and thus does so at the entire facet $\{(p,-\inprod{p}{L(u_r)}) : p\in\gamma_r\}$; by the above, $u_r \in \Gamma(p)$ for all such distributions as well.
  We conclude that $u_r \in \Gamma(p) \iff p \in \gamma_r \iff r \in \gamma(p)$, satisfying condition~\eqref{eq:embed-loss} for $\varphi : r \mapsto u_r$.
  To see that the loss values match, we merely note that the supporting hyperplanes to the facets of $E_L$ and $E_\ell$ are the same, and the loss values are uniquely determined by the supporting hyperplane.
  (In particular, if $h$ supports the facet corresponding to $\gamma_r$, we have $\ell(r)_y = L(u_r)_y = h(\delta_y)$, where $\delta_y$ is the point distribution on outcome $y$.)
\end{proof}

\btw{RF: matching risks is not necessary for \emph{consistency}, as evidenced by logistic loss for 0-1 loss.  Maybe we should just make the observation, earlier on, that \emph{embedding} is not necessary for consistency.}
\btw{RF: DKR (section 3.1) realized the importance of matching Bayes risks, but they could only give general results for strictly convex (concave I should say) risks, in part because they fixed the link function to be a generalization of $\sgn$.  In contrast, we focus exclusively on non-strictly-convex risks.}

From this more succinct embedding condition, we can in turn simplify the condition that a loss embeds \emph{some} discrete loss: it does if and only if its Bayes risk is polyhedral.
(We say a concave function is polyhedral if its negation is a polyhedral convex function.)
Note that the Bayes risk, a function from distributions over $\Y$ to the reals, may be polyhedral even if the loss itself is not.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:embed-risk-poly}
  A loss $L$ embeds a discrete loss if and only if $\risk{L}$ is polyhedral.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  If $L$ embeds $\ell$, Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks} gives us $\risk{L} = \risk{\ell}$, and its proof already argued that $\risk{\ell}$ is polyhedral.
  For the converse, let $\risk{L}$ be polyhedral; we again examine the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks}.
  The projection of $\risk{L}$ onto $\simplex$ forms a power diagram by~\cite{aurenhammer1987power} with finitely many cells $C_1,\ldots,C_k$, which we can index by $\R := \{1,\ldots,k\}$.
  Defining the property $\gamma:\simplex\toto\R$ by $\gamma_r = C_r$ for $r\in\R$, we see that the same construction gives us points $u_r \in\reals^d$ such that $u_r \in \Gamma(p) \iff r \in \gamma(p)$.
  Defining $\ell:\R\to\reals^\Y_+$ by $\ell(r) = L(u_r)$, the same proof shows that $L$ embeds $\ell$.
  % The reverse direction follows similarly to the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks}.
  % Consider, as above, the power diagram induced by projecting $\risk{L}$ onto $\simplex$ corresponding to the level sets of $\Gamma$.
  % Call the set of full-dimensional cells in this power diagram $F$, and note that $F$ is finite since it defined by a projection of a polyhedral function.
  % For each $f \in F$, there is a distribution $p \in \inter{f}$ such that the supporting hyperplane at $\risk{L}(p)$ is unique.
  % Pick some $u_f \in \argmin_{u' \in \U}L(u', p)$.
  % The coefficients of the supporting hyperplane of $\risk{L}(p)$ exactly describe the discrete loss $\ell(u_f)$.
  % Repeat this process for every facet, and denote $\R := \{u_f\}_{f \in F}$.
  % Since $\cup f = \simplex$, and each $f$ isequal to $\Gamma_{u_f}$ for some $u_f \in \reals^d$, we invoke Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-trim} to note $\Gamma:= \prop{L}$ embeds a finite property $\gamma := \prop{\ell}$, and their loss values match up, since $\ell$ is exactly described by the same supporting hyperplanes for each $p \in \simplex$.
% <<<<<<< HEAD
%   For the forward direction, suppose $L$ embeds a discrete loss $\ell$.
%   By Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks}, we know that $\risk{L} = \risk{\ell}$.
%   Since $\ell$ is discrete, $\risk{\ell}$ is polyhedral as the minimum of a finite set of linear functions in $\simplex$. %\raf{do we know? okay, we do---but why?}.
%   Therefore, $\risk{L}$ is polyhedral.
%   The reverse direction follows similarly to the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks}.
%   Consider, as above, the power diagram induced by projecting $\risk{L}$ onto $\simplex$ corresponding to the level sets of $\Gamma$.
%   Call the set of full-dimensional cells in this power diagram $\U'$, where each $U \in \U'$ corresponds to $\Gamma_u$ for some $u \in \U$.
%   For each $u \in \U'$, there is a distribution $p \in \inter{\Gamma_u}$ such that the supporting hyperplane at $\risk{L}(p)$ is unique.
%   Pick some $u \in \argmin_{u' \in \U}L(u', p)$.
%   As before, the coefficients of the supporting hyperplane of $\risk{L}(p)$ exactly describe the discrete loss $\ell(u)$.
%   Repeat this process for every facet.
%   Since $\cup_{\U'} \Gamma_u = \simplex$, we invoke Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-trim} to note $\Gamma:= \prop{L}$ embeds a finite property $\gamma := \prop{\ell}$, and their loss values match up, since $\ell$ is exactly described by the same supporting hyperplanes for each $p \in \simplex$.
% =======
\end{proof}

Combining Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-risk-poly} with the observation that polyhedral losses have polyhedral Bayes risks~\cite[Lemma 5]{finocchiaro2019embedding}, we obtain the first direction of our equivalence between polyhedral losses and embedding.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:poly-embeds-discrete}
  Every polyhedral loss $L$ embeds a discrete loss.
\end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%   We simply apply Lemma~\ref{lem:poly-loss-poly-risk} and Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-risk-poly}.
% \end{proof}

We now turn to the reverse direction: which discrete losses are embedded by some polyhedral loss?
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that \emph{every} discrete loss is embeddable,
using a construction via convex conjugate duality which has appeared several times in the literature (e.g.\ \cite{duchi2018multiclass,abernethy2013efficient,frongillo2014general}).
Note however that the number of dimensions $d$ required could be as large as $|\Y|$.
%\raft{CITE: DKR, frongillo-kash (WINE 2014), probably one of Bob's papers?, others?}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable}
  Every discrete loss $\ell$ is embedded by a polyhedral loss.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $n = |\Y|$, and let $C:\reals^n \to \reals$ be given by $(-\risk{\ell})^*$, the convex conjugate of $-\risk{\ell}$.
  From standard results in convex analysis, $C$ is polyhedral as $-\risk{\ell}$ is, and $C$ is finite on all of $\reals^\Y$ as the domain of $-\risk{\ell}$ is bounded~\cite[Corollary 13.3.1]{rockafellar1997convex}.
  Note that $-\risk{\ell}$ is a closed convex function, as the infimum of affine functions, and thus $(-\risk{\ell})^{**} = -\risk{\ell}$.
  Define $L:\reals^n\to\reals^\Y$ by $L(u) = C(u)\ones - u$, where $\ones\in\reals^\Y$ is the all-ones vector.
  We first show that $L$ embeds $\ell$, and then establish that the range of $L$ is in fact $\reals^\Y_+$, as desired.

  We compute Bayes risks and apply Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks} to see that $L$ embeds $\ell$.
  For any $p\in\simplex$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \risk{L}(p)
    &= \inf_{u\in\reals^n} \inprod{p}{C(u)\ones - u}\\
    &= \inf_{u\in\reals^n} C(u) - \inprod{p}{u}\\
    &= -\sup_{u\in\reals^n} \inprod{p}{u} - C(u)\\
    &= -C^*(p) = - (-\risk{\ell}(p))^{**} = \risk{\ell}(p)~.
  \end{align*}
  It remains to show $L(u)_y \geq 0$ for all $u\in\reals^n$, $y\in\Y$.
  Letting $\delta_y\in\simplex$ be the point distribution on outcome $y\in\Y$, we have for all $u\in\reals^n$, $L(u)_y \geq \inf_{u'\in\reals^n} L(u')_y = \risk{L}(\delta_y) = \risk{\ell}(\delta_y) \geq 0$, where the final inequality follows from the nonnegativity of $\ell$.
  \btw{FUTURE: to get $n-1$, just use the same trick as before and note that the Bayes risk doesn't change.  Should be a couple lines.  (Not needed for NeurIPS since we don't focus on the dimension.)}
\end{proof}

\btw{Cut summary for now (Why is this cool?)}

%\begin{corollary}\label{cor:finite-elicit-embed}
%  Let $\gamma$ be a finite property.
%  The following are equivalent.
%  \begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
%  \item $\gamma$ is elicitable.
%  \item $\gamma$ is embeddable.
%  \item $\gamma$ is embeddable via a polyhedral loss.
%  \end{enumerate}
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%  We trivially have $3\Rightarrow 2$.
%  The direction $1\Rightarrow 3$ follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable}, by taking any discrete loss which elicits $\gamma$.
%  Finally, to see $2\Rightarrow 1$,
%  \raf{This follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-trim}, but we're stating this as a corollary... let's see if it follows more directly from the above.  If it doesn't (one complication: there is no discrete loss starting from $2$ or $3$!) we can rephrase it as a theorem / proposition.}
%\end{proof}


\section{Consistency via Calibrated Links}
\label{sec:calibration}

We have now seen the tight relationship between polyhedral losses and embeddings; in particular, every polyhedral loss embeds some discrete loss.
The embedding itself tells us how to link the embedded points back to the discrete reports (map $\varphi(r)$ to $r$), but it is not clear when this link can be extended to the remaining reports, and whether such a link can lead to consistency.
In this section, we give a construction to generate calibrated links for \emph{any} polyhedral loss.

\bo{Removed comments to point to appendix, since that creates more links...}

The full version~\cite[Appendix~D]{finocchiaro2019embedding} contains the full proof; this section provides a sketch along with the main construction and result.
The first step is to give a link $\psi$ such that exactly minimizing expected surrogate loss $L$, followed by applying $\psi$, always exactly minimizes expected original loss $\ell$.
The existence of such a link is somewhat subtle, because in general some point $u$ that is far from any embedding point can minimize expected loss for two very different distributions $p,p'$, making it unclear whether there exists a choice $\psi(u)\in\R$ that is $\ell$-optimal for both distributions.
We show that as we vary $p$ over $\simplex$, there are only finitely many sets of the form $U = \argmin_{u \in \reals^d} \inprod{p}{L(u)}$~\cite[Lemma 4]{finocchiaro2019embedding}.
Associating each $U$ with $R_U \subseteq \R$, the set of reports whose embedding points are in $U$, we enforce that all points in $U$ link to some report in $R_U$.
(As a special case, embedding points must link to their corresponding reports.)
Proving that these choices are well-defined uses a chain of arguments involving the Bayes risk, ultimately showing that if $u$ lies in multiple such sets $U$, the corresponding report sets $R_U$ all intersect at some $r =: \psi(u)$.

%
%\begin{proposition}\label{prop:embed-link}
%  Let $L$ elicit $\Gamma:\simplex\toto\reals^d$ which embeds a finite property $\gamma$.
%  Then there exists a link function $\psi: \reals^d \to \R$ that is \emph{valid} in the sense that, for any $p$, if $u$ minimizes expected $L$-loss (i.e. $u \in \Gamma(p)$, then $\psi(u)$ minimizes expected $\ell$-loss (i.e. $\psi(u) \in \gamma(p)$).
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $\gamma:\simplex\toto\R$.
%  Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-trim} gives us that $\trim(\Gamma) = \{\gamma_r : r\in\R\}$.
%  \bo{Have we defined trim already? Or is this proof going to the appendix?}
%  Then for any $u\in\reals^d$, there is some $r\in\R$ such that $\Gamma_u \subseteq \gamma_r$.
%  The link $\psi : \reals^d \to \R$ which encodes these choices is valid.
%\end{proof}

Intuitively, to ensure calibration, we just need to ``thicken'' this construction, by mapping all approximately-optimal points $u$ to optimal reports $r$.
Let $\U$ contain all optimal report sets $U$ of the form above.
A key step in the following definition will be to narrow down a ``link envelope'' $\Psi$ where $\Psi(u)$ denotes the legal or valid choices for $\psi(u)$.

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{lem:polyhedral-range-gamma}
%  Let $L:\reals^d\to\reals_+^\Y$ be a polyhedral loss, and let $\Gamma = \prop{L}$.
%  Then the range of $\Gamma$, $\U = \Gamma(\simplex) = \{\Gamma(p) \subseteq \reals^d | p\in\simplex\}$, is a finite set of closed polyhedra.
%\end{lemma}
%For each of these finitely many $U \in \U$, we let $R_U$ be the set of reports whose embedding points lie in $U$.
%The idea will be to map points in $U$, as well as points nearby, to something in $R_U$
%We show in the full version \bo{okay wording?} that for any $p$, if $U = \Gamma(p)$, then $R_U = \gamma(p)$.

\begin{definition} \label{def:eps-thick-link}
  Given a polyhedral $L$ that embeds some $\ell$, an $\epsilon > 0$, and a norm $\|\cdot\|$, the \emph{$\epsilon$-thickened link} $\psi$ is constructed as follows.
  First, initialize $\Psi: \reals^d \toto \R$ by setting $\Psi(u) = \R$ for all $u$.
  Then for each $U \in \U$, for all points $u$ such that $\inf_{u^* \in U} \|u^*-u\| < \epsilon$, update $\Psi(u) = \Psi(u) \cap R_U$.
  Finally, define $\psi(u) \in \Psi(u)$, breaking ties arbitrarily.
  If $\Psi(u)$ became empty, then leave $\psi(u)$ undefined.
\end{definition}

\btw{JOURNAL: cool to point out that when $L$ is polyhedral, $\prop{L}$ has a finite range (this result) and so does its (multivalued map) inverse (trim result)!}

% \begin{proposition}
%   If $\psi$ is a separated link between losses $L$ and $\ell$, then $L$ and $\psi$ are consistenty with $\ell$. \jessie{Rephrase?}
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
%   \raf{Use Hari's theorems from their section 8.}
% \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:eps-thick-calibrated}
  Let $L$ be polyhedral, and $\ell$ the discrete loss it embeds from Theorem~\ref{thm:poly-embeds-discrete}.
  Then for small enough $\epsilon > 0$, the $\epsilon$-thickened link $\psi$ is well-defined and, furthermore, is a calibrated link from $L$ to $\ell$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
  \emph{Well-defined:}
  For the initial construction above, we argued that if some collection such as $U,U',U''$ overlap at a $u$, then their report sets $R_U, R_{U'}, R_{U''}$ also overlap, so there is a valid choice $r = \psi(u)$.
  Now, we thicken all sets $U \in \U$ by a small enough $\epsilon$; it can be shown that if the \emph{thickened} sets overlap at $u$, then $U,U',U''$ themselves overlap, so again $R_U, R_{U'}, R_{U''}$ overlap and there is a valid chioce $r = \psi(u)$.

  \emph{Calibrated:} By construction of the thickened link, if $u$ maps to an incorrect report, i.e.\ $\psi(u) \not\in \gamma(p)$, then $u$ must have at least distance $\epsilon$ to the optimal set $U$.
  We then show that the minimal gradient of the expected loss along any direction away from $U$ is lower-bounded, giving a constant excess expected loss at $u$.
\end{proof}

\btw{FUTURE: we should comment in the discussion section that we probably can show that *any* loss embedding $\ell$ must be polyhedral-ish, meaning polyhedral except for stuff that is never optimal.  This theorem would then not need the ``polyhedral'' part. This is related to the ``convex envelope conjucture'', that if $L$ embeds $\ell$ via $\varphi$, you can just take the loss $L'$ such that $L_y$ is the convex envelope of points $\{(\varphi(r),L(r)_y)\}_{r\in\R}$.}
\btw{FUTURE: This prop and theorem give an excellent reason to focus on embeddings, since other techniques do not necessarily give you separated links for free.  Since we know we get them for free, we can just focus on the property, and study elicitation complexity; we know if we have a link at all it can be taken to be separated.  [[Is this true?]]}

Note that the construction given above in Definition~\ref{def:eps-thick-link} is not necessarily computationally efficient as the number of labels $n$ grows.
In practice this potential inefficiency is not typically a concern, as the family of losses typically has some closed form expression in terms of $n$, and thus the construction can proceed at the symbolic level.
We illustrate this formulaic approach in \S~\ref{sec:abstain}.
% \proposedadd{In general, we are not overly concerned with the computational complexity of computing the surrogate and link, since these calculations only need to be computed once.  They are generally derived mathematically, rather than computationally.  These symbolic calculations typically tend to be straightforward, but can sometimes be tricky.}

\section{Application to Specific Surrogates}\label{sec:examples}

Our results give a framework to construct consistent surrogates and link functions for any discrete loss, but they also provide a way to verify the consistency or inconsistency of given surrogates.
Below, we illustrate the power of this framework with specific examples from the literature, as well as new examples.
In some cases we simplify existing proofs, while in others we give new results, such as a new calibrated link for abstain loss, and the inconsistency of the recently proposed Lov\'asz hinge.
\btw{RF: The top-k and hypercube/set examples (except abstain) have the link built in, e.g.\ as the sign function), and they just work around it.  Our results may suggest that it's worth thinking ``outside the box'' (HAH, genious...) and looking for embeddings which are not the hypercube.}


\subsection{Consistency of abstain surrogate and link construction}
\label{sec:abstain}

In classification settings with a large number of labels, several authors consider a variant of classification, with the addition of a ``reject'' or \emph{abstain} option.
For example, \citet{ramaswamy2018consistent} study the loss $\ellabs{\alpha} : [n] \cup \{\bot\} \to \reals^\Y_+$ defined by $\ellabs{\alpha}(r)_y = 0$ if $r=y$, $\alpha$ if $r = \bot$, and 1 otherwise.
%\begin{align}\label{eq:abstain-discrete}
%$\ellabs{\alpha}(r)_y = \begin{cases}
%0 & r = y\\
%\alpha & r = \bot\\
%1 & \text{otherwise}
%\end{cases}~.$
%\end{align}
Here, the report $\bot$ corresponds to ``abstaining'' if no label is sufficiently likely, specifically, if no $y\in\Y$ has $p_y \geq 1-\alpha$.
\citet{ramaswamy2018consistent} provide a polyhedral surrogate for $\ellabs{\alpha}$, which we present here for $\alpha=1/2$.
Letting $d = \ceil{\log_2(n)}$ their surrogate is $L_{1/2} : \reals^d \to \reals^\Y_+$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:abstain-surrogate}
L_{1/2}(u)_y = \left(\max\nolimits_{j \in [d]}B(y)_j u_j + 1\right)_+~,
\end{equation}
where $B:[n]\to\{-1,1\}^d$ is a arbitrary injection; let us assume $n = 2^d$ so that we have a bijection.
Consistency is proven for the following link function,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:abstain-link}
  \psi(u) = \begin{cases}
	\bot & \min_{i \in [d]} |u_i| \leq 1/2\\
	B^{-1}(\sgn(-u)) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}~.
\end{equation}

In light of our framework, we can see that $L_{1/2}$ is an excellent example of an embedding, where $\varphi(y) = B(y)$ and $\varphi(\bot) = 0 \in \reals^d$.
Moreover, the link function $\psi$ can be recovered from Theorem~\ref{thm:eps-thick-calibrated} with norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ and $\epsilon=1/2$; see Figure~\ref{fig:abstain-links}(L).
Hence, our framework would have simplified the process of finding such a link, and the corresponding proof of consistency.
To illustrate this point further, we give an alternate link $\psi_1$ corresponding to $\|\cdot\|_1$ and $\epsilon=1$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:abstain-links}(R):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:abstain-link-1}
  \psi_1(u) = \begin{cases}
	\bot & \|u\|_1 \leq 1\\
	B^{-1}(\sgn(-u)) &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}~.
\end{equation}
Theorem~\ref{thm:eps-thick-calibrated} immediately gives calibration of $(L_{1/2},\psi_1)$ with respect to $\ellabs{1/2}$.
Aside from its simplicity, one possible advantage of $\psi_1$ is that it appears to yield the same constant in generalization bounds as $\psi$, yet assigns $\bot$ to much less of the surrogate space $\reals^d$.
It would be interesting to compare the two links in practice.

\subsection{Inconsistency of Lov\'asz hinge}
\label{sec:lovasz-hinge}

Many structured prediction settings can be thought of as making multiple predictions at once, with a loss function that jointly measures error based on the relationship between these predictions~\cite{hazan2010direct, gao2011consistency, osokin2017structured}.
In the case of $k$ binary predictions, these settings are typically formalized by taking the predictions and outcomes to be $\pm 1$ vectors, so $\R=\Y=\{-1,1\}^k$.
One then defines a joint loss function, which is often merely a function of the set of mispredictions, meaning we may write $\ell^g(r)_y = g(\{i \in [k] : r_i \neq y_i\})$ for some set function $g:2^{[k]}\to\reals$.
For example, Hamming loss is given by $g(S) = |S|$.
In an effort to provide a general convex surrogate for these settings when $g$ is a submodular function, Yu and Blaschko~\cite{yu2018lovasz} introduce the \emph{Lov\'asz hinge}, which leverages the well-known convex Lov\'asz extension of submodular functions.
While the authors provide theoretical justification and experiments, consistency of the Lov\'asz hinge is left open, which we resolve.

Rather than formally define the Lov\'asz hinge, we defer the complete analysis to the full version of the paper~\cite{finocchiaro2019embedding}, and focus here on the $k=2$ case.
For brevity, we write $g_\emptyset := g(\emptyset)$, $g_{1,2} := g(\{1,2\})$, etc.
%\raft{Jessie: I meant \emph{our} paper :-].  Leaving this here:\cite{yu2015lovaszarxiv}}
Assuming $g$ is normalized and increasing (meaning $g_{1,2} \geq \{g_1,g_2\} \geq g_\emptyset = 0$), the Lov\'asz hinge $L:\reals^k\to\reals^\Y_+$ is given by
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:lovasz-hinge}
  L^g(u)_y = \max\Bigl\{(1-u_1y_1)_+ g_1 + (1-u_2y_2)_+ (g_{1,2}-g_1),\\[-4pt] (1-u_2y_2)_+ g_2 + (1-u_1y_1)_+ (g_{1,2}-g_2)\Bigr\}~,
\end{multline}
where $(x)_+ = \max\{x,0\}$.
We will explore the range of values of $g$ for which $L^g$ is consistent, where the link function $\psi:\reals^2\to\{-1,1\}^2$ is fixed as $\psi(u)_i = \sgn(u_i)$, with ties broken arbitrarily.

Let us consider the coefficients $g_\emptyset = 0$, $g_1 = g_2 = g_{1,2} = 1$, for which $\ell^g$ is merely 0-1 loss on $\Y$.
For consistency, for any distribution $p\in\simplex$, we must have that whenever $u \in \argmin_{u'\in\reals^2} \inprod{p}{L^g(u')}$, the outcome $\psi(u)$ must be the most likely, i.e., in $\argmax_{y\in\Y} p(y)$.
Simplifying eq.~\eqref{eq:lovasz-hinge}, however, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lovasz-hinge-abstain}
  L^g(u)_y = \max\bigl\{(1-u_1y_1)_+,(1-u_2y_2)_+\bigr\} = \max\bigl\{1-u_1y_1,1-u_2y_2,0\bigr\}~,
\end{equation}
which is exactly the abstain surrogate~\eqref{eq:abstain-surrogate} for $d=2$.
We immediately conclude that $L^g$ cannot be consistent with $\ell^g$, as the origin will be the unique optimal report for $L^g$ under distributions with $p_y < 0.5$ for all $y$, and one can simply take a distribution which disagrees with the way ties are broken in $\psi$.
For example, if we take $\sgn(0) = 1$, then under $p((1,1)) = p((1,-1)) = p((-1,1)) = 0.2$ and $p((-1,-1)) = 0.4$, we have $\{0\} = \argmin_{u\in\reals^2} \inprod{p}{L^g(u)}$, yet we also have $\psi(0) = (1,1) \notin \{(-1,-1)\} = \argmin_{r\in\R} \inprod{p}{\ell^g(r)}$.

In fact, this example is typical: using our embedding framework, and characterizing when $0\in\reals^2$ is an embedded point, one can show that $L^g$ is consistent if and only if $g_{1,2} = g_1 + g_2$.
Moreover, in this linear case, which corresponds to $g$ being \emph{modular}, the Lov\'asz hinge reduces to weighted Hamming loss, which is trivially consistent from the consistency of hinge loss for 0-1 loss.
In the full version of the paper~\cite{finocchiaro2019embedding}, we generalize this observation for all $k$: $L^g$ is consistent if and only if $g$ is modular.
In other words, even for $k>2$, the only consistent Lov\'asz hinge is weighted Hamming loss.
These results cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Lov\'asz hinge in practice.


% \subsection{New surrogates for cost-sensitive classification}

% \raf{I think we should cut this subsection, and maybe just remind the reader at the prelude to this section that Theorem~\ref{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable} gives a construction for any discrete loss.}
% The construction given in Theorem~\ref{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable}, together with the calibrated link construction in Section~\ref{sec:calibration}, can generate consistent convex surrogates for arbitrary discrete losses.
% For example, consider cost-sensitive classification; given an arbitrary loss matrix $C \in \reals^{n\times n}_+$ describing the loss $\ell_j(i) = C_{ij}$ of predicting label $i$ when the true label is $j$, we construct a convex surrogate based on the convex conjugate of $-\risk{\ell}$.
% While of course several surrogates are known for this problem~\cite{pires2013cost}, they typically work in $n$ dimensions.
% %\raf{Jessie, could you cite \url{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/avilapires13.pdf} here}
% one advantage of our embedding framework is the ability to construct lower-dimensional surrogates when costs have certain geometric interpretations.
% For example, if $v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \reals^k$ are on the unit sphere and $C_{ij} = \inprod{v_i}{v_j}$, we can simply take $L_j(u) = $\raf{aaaand Noah woke up}\raf{Just realized that this loss matrix has rank $k$ and thus is covered by AA15: just elicit the linear property $\E v_Y \in \reals^k$.}

\subsection{Inconsistency of top-$k$ losses}
% 7.14.19- proposed version for arXiv
\btw{The story we discussed: YK show $L'$ is inconsistent.  Our framework lets us ask: with what discrete loss \emph{is} $L'$ consistent?  (It also assures us that $L'$ is consistent for something...) Oh look, $L'$ embeds something which is $\elltopk$ plus some other term, so (a) we can see very clearly what $L'$ ``is doing'', and (b) we can see where to look for distributions yielding inconsistency, namely ones for which we actually prefer to report a set with $|r|<k$.}

% As one instance, the top-$k$ classification problem is to predict the set of $k$ most likely labels; formally, we have $\R := \{r \subseteq [n] : |r| = k\}$, $\Y = [n]$, 
% $1<k<n$, and discrete loss $\elltopk : r \mapsto \Ind{y \not\in r}$.
In certain classification problems when ground truth may be ambiguous, such as object identification, it is common to predict a set of possible labels.
As one instance, the top-$k$ classification problem is to predict the set of $k$ most likely labels; formally, we have $\R := \{r \in \{0,1\}^n : \|r\|_0 = k\}$, $1<k<n$, $\Y = [n]$, and discrete loss $\elltopk(r)_y = 1-r_y$.
Surrogates for this problem commonly take reports $u\in\reals^n$, with the link $\psi(u) = \{u_{[1]},\ldots,u_{[k]}\}$, where $u_{[i]}$ is the $i^{th}$ largest entry of $u$.
% , with ties broken arbitrarily.

\citet{lapin2015top, lapin2016loss, lapin2018analysis} provide the following convex surrogate loss for this problem, which \citet{yang2018consistency} show to be inconsistent:%
\footnote{Yang and Koyejo also introduce a consistent surrogate, but it is non-convex.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:L-2-surrogate}
L^k(u)_y := \left( 1-u_y + \tfrac{1}{k} \textstyle\sum_{i=1}^k (u - e_y)_{[i]} \right)_+~,
\end{align}
where $e_y$ is $1$ in component $y$ and 0 elsewhere.
With our framework, we can say more.
Specifically, while $(L^k,\psi)$ is not consistent for $\elltopk$, since $L^k$ is polyhedral, we know from Theorem~\ref{thm:poly-embeds-discrete} that it embeds \emph{some} discrete loss $\ell^k$, and from Theorem~\ref{thm:eps-thick-calibrated} there is a link $\psi'$ such that $(L^k,\psi')$ is calibrated (and consistent) for $\ell^k$.
We therefore turn to deriving this discrete loss $\ell^k$.

For concreteness, consider the case with $k = 2$ over $n=3$ outcomes.
We can re-write $L^2(u)_y = \left(1 - u_y + \tfrac 1 2 (u_{[1]}+ u_{[2]} - \min(1,u_y))\right)_+$.
By inspection, we can derive the properties elicited by $\elltop{2}$ and $L^2$, respectively, which reveals that the set $\R'$ consisting of all permutations of $(1,0,0)$, $(1,1,0)$, and $(2,1,0)$, are always represented among the minimizers of $L^2$.
Thus, $L^2$ embeds the loss $\ell^2(r)_y = 0$ if $r_y = 2$ or $\ell^2(r)_y = 1 - r_y + \tfrac 1 2 \inprod{r}{\ones-e_y}$ otherwise.
Observe that $\ell^2$ is just $\elltop{2}$ with an extra term punishing weight on elements other than $y$, and a reward for a weight of 2 on $y$.

Moreover, we can visually inspect the corresponding properties (Fig.~\ref{fig:top-k-simplices}) to immediately see why $L^2$ is inconsistent: for distributions where the two least likely labels are roughly equally (un)likely, the minimizer will put all weight on the most likely label, and thus fail to distinguish the other two.
More generally, $L^2$ cannot be consistent because the property it embeds does not ``refine'' (subdivide) the top-$k$ property, so not just $\psi$, but \emph{no} link function, could make $L^2$ consistent.

% Similarly, for every distribution $p \in \Delta_3$, $\inprod{p}{L^2}$ has a minimizer in the set $\R'$ composed of the tuples shown in Figure~\ref{fig:top-k-simplices} (right), and thus $\risk{L^2} = \risk{\ell^2}$, where $\ell^2 := L^2|_{\R'}$, so Figure~\ref{fig:top-k-simplices} (right) shows $\gamma^2 := \prop{\ell^2}$.
% %Therefore, we know $L^2$ embeds $\ell^2$ by Proposition~\ref{prop:embed-bayes-risks}.

%\end{align}
%where $e_y$ is $1$ in component $y$ and 0 elsewhere.
%
%With our framework, we can say more.
%Specifically, while $(L',\psi)$ is not consistent for $\elltopk$, since $L'$ is polyhedral (Lemma~\ref{lem:top-k-polyhedral}), we know from Theorem~\ref{thm:poly-embeds-discrete} that it embeds \emph{some} discrete loss $\ell'$, and from Theorem~\ref{thm:eps-thick-calibrated} there is a link $\psi'$ such that $(L',\psi')$ is calibrated (and consistent) for $\ell'$.
%We therefore turn to deriving this discrete loss $\ell'$.
%
%In Lemma~\ref{lem:top-k-optimal-corners}\jessiet{in the Appendix... remove ref for camera ready version}, we show that the set $\U = \{u \in \{0,1\}^n : \|u\|_0 \leq k\}$ is always represented among the optimizers of $L'$, meaning for all $p \in \simplex$ we have $\prop{L'}(p) \cap \U \neq \emptyset$.
%From Lemma~\ref{lem:loss-restrict}\raft{was Lemma~\ref{lem:top-k-surrogate-embeds}}, then, $L'$ must embed $L'|_\U$, which gives us $\ell':\R'\to\reals^\Y_+$ via the natural embedding from sets $\R' = \{r \subseteq [n] : |r| \leq k\}$ to their indicator vectors:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:ell-2}
%\ell'(r)_y &= \Ind{y \not\in r} + \tfrac 1 k |r \setminus \{y\}| = (1+\tfrac 1 k)\Ind{y \not\in r} + \tfrac 1 k (|r|-1)~.
%\end{align}
%We now see that $\ell'$ is essentially $\elltopk$ (extended to sets smaller than $k$) plus an additional cardinality term which rewards smaller sets.
%
%Knowledge of what loss $L'$ actually embeds greatly simplifies the task of proving inconsistency with $\elltopk$.
%Specifically, we see that $\ell'$ allows sets of cardinality strictly less than $k$, so we can look for a distribution making one of these smaller sets optimal.
%Writing the expected loss, we have
%%$\inprod{p}{\ell'(r)} = 1 - p(r) + \tfrac 1 k (|r|-p(r)) = 1 + \tfrac 1 k |r| - (1 + \tfrac 1 k) p(r)$,\\
%$\inprod{p}{\ell'(r)} = (1+\tfrac 1 k)(1 - p(r)) + \tfrac 1 k (|r|-1) = 1 + \tfrac 1 k |r| - (1 + \tfrac 1 k) p(r)$, where $p(r) = \sum_{i\in r} p_i$.
%% It is now easy to see that the optimal $r$ for any fixed cardinality $|r|=c$ is the $c$ most likely labels.
%So let us ask when it is better to drop an element $i$ from $r$:
%% If $i$ is the index of the $c$th most likely label (so $p_i = p_{[c]}$)
%we have $\inprod{p}{\ell'(r)-\ell'(r\setminus\{i\})} = \tfrac 1 k - (1+\tfrac 1 k)p_i$, meaning we will drop elements from $r$ until they all have weight at least $\tfrac 1 {k+1}$.
%In particular, for distributions close to uniform, $r=\emptyset$ is optimal, already giving us inconsistency\raft{If space (nope) we should spell this out like Jessie did: however ties are broken at $u=0$, pick a distribution with bumps going against the ties, and $u=0$ is still optimal.}.
%More generally, as $k < n$, the set $P = \{p\in\simplex : \max_{r\in\R'} p(r) < k/(k+1)\}$ is full-dimensional and guarantees that at least one of the top $k$ labels has probability strictly less than $\tfrac 1 {k+1}$.
%
%% We now focus on the case where $k=1$; the top-$k$ loss reduces to 0-1 loss in this case.
%% To show a set of distributions where $\prop{\ell'}(p) \neq \prop{\elltopk}(p)$, we claim that $\vec{0}~\in~\prop{\ell'} \implies \risk{\ell'}(p) = 1$ for any $p$ with $\max_y p_y \leq 1/2$.
%% Additionally $\risk{\ell_{top-1}}(p) = 1 - \max_y p_y < 1 \implies \vec{0} \not\in \prop{\elltopk}(p)$.
%
%% First, $\ell(\vec{0}, \bar{p}) = 1$ for all $p \in \simplex$.
%% Taking the set $\{y\}$ for any $y \in \Y$, the expected loss $\inprod{p}{\ell'(\{y\})} = 2 (1-p_y) \geq 1$ by assumption on $p$.
%% %For any $r$ such that $|r| \geq 2$ \jessiet{In general, $|r| \geq k+1$}, we know that  $\ell'(r)_y \geq 1$ for all $y \in \Y$, so the expected loss much be greater than or equal to $1$.
%% Therefore, we have that $\vec{0} \in \prop{\ell'}(p)$ but $\vec{0} \not\in \prop{\elltopk}(p)$ for any $p$ such that $\max_y p_y \leq 1/2$.
%
%
%
%%Since we can see that $\ell' \neq \elltopk$, we can then see that $L'$ is not consistent with respect to $\elltopk$.
%%Similarly, given $L_4(u,y) := \max\left(\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k (1 + u_{\setminus y})_{[i]} - s_y, 0\right)$, we can actually see that $L_4$ also embeds $\ell'$.

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions} \label{sec:conclusion}
% \paragraph{Summary.}
This paper formalizes an intuitive way to design convex surrogate losses for classification-like problems---by embedding the reports into $\reals^d$.
We establish a close relationship between embeddings and polyhedral surrogates, showing both that every polyhedral loss embeds a discrete loss (Theorem~\ref{thm:poly-embeds-discrete}) and that every discrete loss is embedded by some polyhedral loss (Theorem~\ref{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable}).
We then construct a calibrated link function from any polyhedral loss to the discrete loss it embeds, giving consistency for all such losses (Theorem~\ref{thm:eps-thick-calibrated}).
We conclude with examples of how the embedding framework presented can be applied to understand existing surrogates in the literature, including those for the abstain loss, top-$k$ loss, and Lov\'asz hinge.
In particular, our link construction recovers the link function proposed by~\citet{ramaswamy2018consistent} for abstain loss, as well as another simpler link based on the $L_1$ norm.

%%%% Pre-neurips
%This work is part of a broader research program to understand convex surrogates through the lens of property elicitation.  % the relationship between finite losses and convex surrogates, the link functions connecting them, and the properties they elicit.
%We seek a general theory that, given a property, can prescribe when and how to construct convex surrogate losses that elicit it, and specifically, determine the minimum dimension required.
%Even more broadly, one could replace ``convex'' by any notion of ``nice'' surrogate.
%
%This work formalized the \emph{embedding} approach where labels are identified with points in $\reals^d$.
%We saw in Theorems~\ref{thm:poly-embeds-discrete} and~\ref{thm:discrete-loss-poly-embeddable} that this approach is tightly connected to the use of polyhedral (i.e. piecewise linear convex) loss functions.
%We also saw that it is a general technique that can be used for any finite elicitable property.
%
%Moreover, we established the relationship between polyhedral surrogates and \emph{calibrated links} to the discrete losses they embed.
%\jessie{Add more?}

%We then investigated the \emph{dimensionality} of $\reals^d$ required for such embeddings, giving a characterization in terms of the structure of the property in the simplex.
%This gave a complete understanding of the one-dimensional case, and a complete characterization albeit weaker understanding in higher dimensions.
%RF got here
%The two key conditions are an optimality condition that relates the structure of each level set to existence of polytopes in $\reals^d$ satisfying certain conditions; and a monotonicity condition relating such polytopes for different level sets.
%This yields new lower bounds in particular for the abstain loss.

% \paragraph{Directions.}
One open question of particular interest involves the dimension of the surrogate prediction space; given a discrete loss, can we construct a surrogate that embeds it \emph{of minimal dimension}?
If we na\"ively embed the reports into an $n$-dimensional space, the dimensionality of the problem scales linearly in the number of possible labels $n$.
As the dimension of the optimization problem is a function of this \emph{embedding dimension} $d$, a promising direction is to leverage tools from elicitation complexity~\cite{lambert2008eliciting,frongillo2015elicitation} and convex calibration dimension~\cite{ramaswamy2016convex} to understand when we can take $d <\!\!< n$.
%There are several direct open questions involving the dimension of the surrogate loss.
%It would be interesting and perhaps practically useful to develop further techniques for upper bounds: automatically constructing embeddings in $\reals^d$ and associated polyhedral losses from a given property, with $d$ as small as possible.
%Another direction is additional lower bound techniques, or further development of our necessary conditions.

%This paper also suggests an agenda of defining more nuanced classes of surrogate losses and studying their properties.
%For example, a tangential topic in this work was the characteristics of a ``good'' link function; formalizing and exploring this question is an exciting direction.
%We would also like to move toward a full understanding of the differences between these classes.
%For example, how does embedding dimension compare in general to convex elicitation dimension (the dimensionality $d$ required of \emph{any} convex surrogate loss)?
%These questions have both theoretical interest and potential practical significance.

%\begin{conjecture}
%  $\mathrm{elic}_{embed}(\Gamma) = \mathrm{elic}_{Pcvx}(\Gamma) = \mathrm{elic}_{cvx}(\Gamma)$ for all finite elicitable $\Gamma$.
